Plus500 has free withdrawals and slightly tighter spreads on some forex pairs. eToro charges a $5 withdrawal fee but has a longer inactivity grace period (12 months vs Plus500's 3 months). For real stock investing, eToro wins because it offers commission-free real shares — Plus500 only offers stock CFDs with spreads. Overall fee structures are comparable for CFD trading."

        <p>The short version: eToro is the more versatile platform with real assets and copy trading. Plus500 is a focused, no-frills CFD platform with some genuine advantages for experienced short-term traders. The right choice depends entirely on how you trade.</p>

        <!-- ==================== WHAT IS PLUS500 ==================== -->

        <h2 id="what-is-plus500">What Is Plus500?</h2>

        <p>Plus500 was founded in 2008 in Israel and is now headquartered in Haifa. It is publicly listed on the London Stock Exchange (ticker: PLUS), which gives it a level of financial transparency that many competitors lack. Being a public company means its accounts are audited and its finances are disclosed quarterly &mdash; that is a genuine trust signal.</p>

        <p>Plus500 is a <strong>CFD-only platform</strong>. This is the single most important thing to understand about it. Every instrument you trade on Plus500 &mdash; stocks, forex, indices, commodities, crypto, ETFs &mdash; is a contract for difference. You never own the underlying asset. You are speculating on price movements.</p>

        <p>This makes Plus500 fundamentally different from eToro, where you can buy real shares of Apple, Tesla, or any of thousands of stocks, and actually own them. On Plus500, if you &quot;buy Apple,&quot; you hold a CFD contract that tracks Apple&#x27;s price. You do not own the share. You cannot vote at shareholder meetings. You cannot transfer the share to another broker. And critically, CFDs carry overnight financing charges that eat into long-term positions.</p>

        <p>Plus500 has over 24 million registered accounts globally and is regulated in multiple jurisdictions. It offers a clean, stripped-back trading interface that is designed for people who know what they want to trade and want to execute quickly. There is no social feed, no community features, and no copy trading.</p>

        <p>For what it is &mdash; a dedicated CFD trading platform &mdash; Plus500 does its job well. But it is not trying to be an all-in-one investing platform the way eToro is.</p>

        <!-- ==================== FEES COMPARED ==================== -->

        <h2 id="fees-comparison">Fees Compared</h2>

        <p>Fees are where most people start when comparing brokers, so let us break this down category by category.</p>

        <h3>Spreads</h3>

        <p>Both platforms make money primarily through spreads &mdash; the difference between the buy and sell price of an instrument. Neither charges a traditional commission on trades.</p>

        <p>For forex, Plus500&#x27;s EUR/USD spread typically sits around 0.8 to 1.2 pips, depending on market conditions. eToro&#x27;s EUR/USD spread is around 1.0 pip. These are close enough that for most retail traders, the difference is negligible. On some pairs Plus500 is slightly tighter; on others eToro is comparable. Neither platform will give you institutional-grade spreads &mdash; they are both retail CFD brokers in this respect.</p>

        <p>For stock CFDs, both platforms add a spread on top of the underlying market price. The exact spread varies by instrument and market hours. In my testing, Plus500&#x27;s stock CFD spreads were competitive but not dramatically different from eToro&#x27;s.</p>

        <p>The critical difference is this: eToro lets you buy <strong>real stocks with zero commission and zero spread markup</strong> on the underlying exchange price (market hours only). Plus500 does not offer real stocks at all. So if you are investing in stocks long-term, eToro&#x27;s effective cost is significantly lower because you are not paying a CFD spread or overnight fees.</p>

        <h3>Withdrawal fees</h3>

        <p>Plus500 charges <strong>no withdrawal fee</strong>. This is a clear advantage. eToro charges a flat <strong>$5 per withdrawal</strong>. If you withdraw frequently, this adds up. For occasional withdrawals it is a minor issue, but it is still an unnecessary friction.</p>

        <p>I will be honest &mdash; the $5 withdrawal fee on eToro is one of my least favourite things about the platform. It feels outdated in 2026. Plus500 gets this right.</p>

        <h3>Inactivity fees</h3>

        <p>Both platforms charge a $10 per month inactivity fee, but the grace periods are very different. Plus500 starts charging after just <strong>3 months</strong> of inactivity. eToro gives you <strong>12 months</strong> before the fee kicks in.</p>

        <p>This matters more than you might think. If you set up a Plus500 account, try it out for a few weeks, then forget about it, you could be paying $10 a month within three months. With eToro, you have a full year. For occasional traders or people who take breaks from the markets, eToro&#x27;s grace period is significantly more generous.</p>

        <h3>Currency conversion</h3>

        <p>eToro charges a <strong>0.5% currency conversion fee</strong> when you deposit in a currency other than USD (since eToro accounts are denominated in USD). Plus500 charges <strong>up to 0.7%</strong> for currency conversion, though the exact rate varies. Both fees apply when you deposit in GBP or EUR.</p>

        <p>Neither platform is great here. If you are depositing in pounds or euros, expect a small conversion hit on both. eToro&#x27;s flat 0.5% is at least predictable.</p>

        <h3>Overnight financing (CFDs)</h3>

        <p>If you hold CFD positions overnight, both platforms charge financing fees. These are standard across all CFD brokers and are based on the underlying interest rate plus a markup. For short-term day traders, this is not an issue. For anyone holding CFD positions for weeks or months, overnight fees compound and can significantly erode returns.</p>

        <p>This is another reason why eToro&#x27;s real stock offering matters. If you buy real shares on eToro, there are no overnight fees &mdash; you own the asset. On Plus500, every position is a CFD, so every position held overnight incurs a charge.</p>

        <h3>Guaranteed stop loss orders</h3>

        <p>Plus500 offers <strong>guaranteed stop loss orders</strong> (GSLOs) on many instruments. A guaranteed stop loss ensures your position closes at exactly the price you set, even if the market gaps past it. This is a genuine risk management tool that eToro does not offer.</p>

        <p>The catch: guaranteed stop losses come with a wider spread. You pay a premium for the guarantee. But in volatile markets &mdash; earnings announcements, geopolitical events, overnight gaps &mdash; a guaranteed stop loss can save you from a much larger loss than expected. For CFD traders, this is a legitimate advantage for Plus500.</p>

        </table>

        <!-- ==================== PLATFORM & UX ==================== -->

        <h2 id="platform-experience">Platform &amp; User Experience</h2>

        <p>The user experience on these two platforms reflects their different philosophies.</p>

        <h3>Plus500: Clean and functional</h3>

        <p>Plus500&#x27;s interface is stripped-back and focused. When you log in, you see a list of instruments, a search bar, and your open positions. There is no social feed, no news section, no community discussion &mdash; just the trading interface. Charts are basic but functional. You can set alerts, place orders, and manage risk with stop losses and take profits.</p>

        <p>For experienced traders who know exactly what they want to trade, this simplicity is an advantage. There are no distractions. You open the app, place your trade, set your stop loss, and close the app. The mobile app mirrors this philosophy &mdash; it is fast, lightweight, and straightforward.</p>

        <p>However, for beginners, Plus500&#x27;s interface can feel cold. There is no educational content built into the platform, no community to learn from, and no way to see what other traders are doing. You are on your own.</p>

        <h3>eToro: Social and feature-rich</h3>

        <p>eToro&#x27;s platform is busier, but that is by design. The social feed shows what other investors are doing &mdash; their trades, their commentary, their portfolio performance. You can follow traders, comment on posts, and explore what popular investors are holding.</p>

        <p>The discovery tools are strong. You can browse Popular Investors by risk score, return, and holding period. Smart Portfolios let you invest in themed baskets of assets managed by eToro&#x27;s team. The research section includes analyst ratings, social sentiment data, and news.</p>

        <p>For beginners, eToro&#x27;s social features serve as a learning environment. You can watch experienced traders, understand their reasoning, and learn by observing before you commit real money. The virtual portfolio (paper trading) with $100,000 in virtual funds lets you practise without risk.</p>

        <p>The downside is that eToro&#x27;s platform can feel overwhelming at first. There is a lot going on. For someone who just wants a simple trading interface, Plus500&#x27;s minimalism is appealing.</p>

        <h3>Mobile apps</h3>

        <p>Both apps are well-rated on iOS and Android. Plus500&#x27;s app is particularly fast and smooth &mdash; partly because it has fewer features to load. eToro&#x27;s app is more feature-complete but can occasionally feel slower on older devices due to the social feed and portfolio analytics.</p>

        <p>For day trading or quick position management, Plus500&#x27;s app has a slight edge in speed. For portfolio management, research, and copy trading, eToro&#x27;s app is far more capable.</p>

        <!-- ==================== AVAILABLE ASSETS ==================== -->

        <h2 id="assets">Available Assets</h2>

        <p>This is where the difference between these two platforms becomes stark.</p>

        <h3>eToro: 5,000+ instruments including real assets</h3>

        <p>eToro offers over 5,000 instruments across multiple asset classes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Real stocks</strong> &mdash; 3,000+ from 17 global exchanges, commission-free, with actual ownership</li>
          <li><strong>Real ETFs</strong> &mdash; hundreds of ETFs with real ownership</li>
          <li><strong>Real crypto</strong> &mdash; 80+ cryptocurrencies with actual ownership (you can transfer to eToro Money wallet)</li>
          <li><strong>CFDs</strong> &mdash; stocks, forex, commodities, indices, and crypto CFDs with leverage</li>
          <li><strong>Smart Portfolios</strong> &mdash; managed thematic portfolios</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The key word is &quot;real.&quot; When you buy Tesla stock on eToro (without leverage), you own the actual share. When you buy Bitcoin on eToro, you own the actual Bitcoin. This is fundamentally different from CFD trading.</p>

        <h3>Plus500: 2,800+ CFDs only</h3>

        <p>Plus500 offers over 2,800 instruments, but <strong>every single one is a CFD</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Stock CFDs</strong> &mdash; from major global exchanges</li>
          <li><strong>Forex CFDs</strong> &mdash; 60+ currency pairs</li>
          <li><strong>Index CFDs</strong> &mdash; major global indices</li>
          <li><strong>Commodity CFDs</strong> &mdash; oil, gold, silver, natural gas, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Crypto CFDs</strong> &mdash; Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others</li>
          <li><strong>ETF CFDs</strong> &mdash; popular ETFs as CFDs</li>
          <li><strong>Options CFDs</strong> &mdash; CFDs on options contracts</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There is no real ownership of anything on Plus500. This is not necessarily bad &mdash; CFDs are a legitimate financial product &mdash; but it means Plus500 is unsuitable for long-term investing. CFD overnight fees make holding positions for months or years prohibitively expensive. Plus500 is designed for short-to-medium-term trading.</p>

        <h3>Why this matters</h3>

        <p>If you want to build a long-term stock portfolio, Plus500 is the wrong platform. You cannot buy and hold real shares. You cannot receive dividends on actual stock ownership (CFD dividends are paid as adjustments, but they are not the same as real dividend income). You cannot transfer shares to another broker.</p>

        <p>If you want to trade forex, commodities, or indices on a short-term basis using leverage, Plus500 is a perfectly viable platform with a clean interface and competitive spreads.</p>

        <p>eToro gives you both options. You can invest in real stocks long-term <strong>and</strong> trade CFDs short-term, all from the same account. That flexibility is a significant advantage.</p>

        <!-- ==================== COPY TRADING ==================== -->

        <h2 id="copy-trading">Copy Trading</h2>

        <p>This is eToro&#x27;s knockout punch, and it is not even close.</p>

        <p>Plus500 has <strong>no copy trading feature whatsoever</strong>. There is no social element, no way to follow other traders, no way to automatically mirror anyone&#x27;s trades. It is a solo trading platform, full stop.</p>

        <p>eToro&#x27;s copy trading ecosystem includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>CopyTrader</strong> &mdash; automatically mirrors a trader&#x27;s live positions in real time. When they buy, you buy. When they sell, you sell. Minimum $200 per copied trader.</li>
          <li><strong>Popular Investor Programme</strong> &mdash; experienced traders are ranked and incentivised with up to 1.5% annual AUM payments, creating a genuine ecosystem of accountable investors.</li>
          <li><strong>Smart Portfolios</strong> &mdash; professionally managed, thematic portfolios covering sectors like tech, renewable energy, crypto, and more. Minimum $500.</li>
          <li><strong>Social feed</strong> &mdash; see what traders are posting, what they are buying, and read their market commentary.</li>
          <li><strong>Transparent stats</strong> &mdash; risk scores, return history, drawdown data, and portfolio composition are all visible before you copy anyone.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I have been copy trading on eToro since 2017 and have documented the entire journey across 335+ YouTube videos. Copy trading is not a guaranteed path to profits &mdash; I have had losing periods and I have copied traders who underperformed. But as a system for people who want to participate in the markets without making every individual trade decision themselves, it is genuinely unique among regulated platforms.</p>

        <p>If copy trading is even remotely on your radar, Plus500 is not an option. It simply does not exist there. This is the single biggest differentiator between these two platforms, and for a large portion of potential users, it makes the decision obvious.</p>

        <!-- ==================== REGULATION & SAFETY ==================== -->

        <h2 id="regulation">Regulation &amp; Safety</h2>

        <p>Both platforms are well-regulated, and I want to be fair to Plus500 here &mdash; on paper, it has a slight edge in terms of breadth of regulation.</p>

        <h3>Plus500 regulation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>FCA</strong> (UK) &mdash; Financial Conduct Authority</li>
          <li><strong>CySEC</strong> (Cyprus/EU) &mdash; Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission</li>
          <li><strong>ASIC</strong> (Australia) &mdash; Australian Securities and Investments Commission</li>
          <li><strong>FMA</strong> (New Zealand) &mdash; Financial Markets Authority</li>
          <li><strong>FSCA</strong> (South Africa) &mdash; Financial Sector Conduct Authority</li>
          <li><strong>MAS</strong> (Singapore) &mdash; Monetary Authority of Singapore</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Plus500 is also <strong>publicly listed on the London Stock Exchange</strong> (ticker: PLUS). This means its financial accounts are publicly audited, its executives are personally accountable to shareholders, and there is a level of transparency that private companies do not have. This is a genuine trust advantage.</p>

        <h3>eToro regulation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>FCA</strong> (UK) &mdash; Financial Conduct Authority</li>
          <li><strong>CySEC</strong> (Cyprus/EU) &mdash; Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission</li>
          <li><strong>ASIC</strong> (Australia) &mdash; Australian Securities and Investments Commission</li>
          <li><strong>FinCEN</strong> (USA) &mdash; Financial Crimes Enforcement Network</li>
        </ul>

        <p>eToro was previously publicly listed via SPAC but is currently private. It has over 30 million registered users globally and has been operating since 2007.</p>

        <h3>Investor protection</h3>

        <p>Both platforms provide negative balance protection for retail clients (required under ESMA rules for EU/UK clients). This means you cannot lose more than the money in your account when trading CFDs.</p>

        <p>UK clients on both platforms are covered by the <strong>FSCS (Financial Services Compensation Scheme)</strong> for up to &pound;85,000 in the event the platform becomes insolvent. This is a regulatory requirement for FCA-authorised firms.</p>

        <p>In terms of safety, both platforms are legitimate, well-regulated, and have operated for over 15 years without major regulatory scandals. Plus500&#x27;s public listing gives it a marginal edge in transparency, but both are solid choices from a regulatory standpoint.</p>

        <!-- ==================== WHO SHOULD CHOOSE PLUS500 ==================== -->

        <h2 id="who-plus500">Who Should Choose Plus500 Over eToro?</h2>

        <p>I want to be genuinely fair here. Despite being an eToro user myself, there are specific use cases where Plus500 is the better choice:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Experienced CFD traders</strong> who want a clean, fast, no-nonsense interface without social features or distractions. If you know what you are trading and just want to execute, Plus500&#x27;s simplicity is an advantage.</li>
          <li><strong>Forex traders</strong> who prioritise tight spreads on major pairs. Plus500&#x27;s EUR/USD spread can be slightly tighter than eToro&#x27;s during peak hours.</li>
          <li><strong>Traders who want guaranteed stop losses</strong>. This is a genuine risk management tool that eToro does not offer. In volatile markets, a guaranteed stop loss can protect you from slippage and gaps.</li>
          <li><strong>People who withdraw frequently</strong>. Plus500&#x27;s zero withdrawal fee is a clear advantage over eToro&#x27;s $5 charge.</li>
          <li><strong>Traders who value the transparency of a publicly listed company</strong>. Plus500&#x27;s London Stock Exchange listing means quarterly financial disclosures and public accountability.</li>
          <li><strong>Short-term traders</strong> who have no interest in long-term investing, copy trading, or real stock ownership. If you are purely trading CFDs on a daily or weekly basis, Plus500&#x27;s focused platform makes sense.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Plus500 is a good platform for what it does. The problem is that what it does is narrow &mdash; CFD trading only &mdash; and for many people, that is not enough.</p>

        <!-- ==================== WHO SHOULD STICK WITH ETORO ==================== -->

        <h2 id="who-etoro">Who Should Stick With eToro?</h2>

        <p>eToro is the better choice for the majority of retail investors. Here is why:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Copy trading enthusiasts</strong>. If you want to mirror experienced traders automatically, eToro is the only major regulated platform that offers this. Plus500 has nothing comparable.</li>
          <li><strong>Long-term stock investors</strong>. eToro lets you buy and own real shares commission-free. Plus500 only offers stock CFDs, which are unsuitable for long-term holding due to overnight fees.</li>
          <li><strong>Beginners</strong>. eToro&#x27;s social features, virtual portfolio, and copy trading provide a gentler learning curve. Plus500 drops you into a CFD trading interface with no guidance or community support.</li>
          <li><strong>Crypto investors</strong>. eToro offers real cryptocurrency ownership. Plus500 only offers crypto CFDs &mdash; you never own the actual coins.</li>
          <li><strong>Diversified investors</strong>. If you want real stocks, ETFs, crypto, and CFDs all in one place, eToro offers that. Plus500 is CFDs across the board.</li>
          <li><strong>Occasional traders</strong>. eToro&#x27;s 12-month inactivity grace period is far more forgiving than Plus500&#x27;s 3-month window. If you take breaks from trading, eToro gives you breathing room.</li>
          <li><strong>People who want Smart Portfolios</strong>. eToro&#x27;s managed thematic portfolios are a simple way to invest in sectors or themes without picking individual assets. Plus500 has no equivalent.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I use eToro because copy trading is central to my strategy, and because I can hold real stocks and real crypto alongside my copy trading positions. That combination is not available on any other single platform I have found.</p>

        <!-- ==================== FINAL VERDICT ==================== -->

        <h2 id="final-verdict">Final Verdict</h2>

        <p>After spending time on both platforms, here is my honest take: <strong>eToro is the better all-round platform for most people</strong>. It offers real stock ownership, genuine copy trading, a social investing community, real crypto, Smart Portfolios, and a more beginner-friendly experience. The breadth of what you can do on eToro is simply wider.</p>

        <p>Plus500 is a solid CFD trading platform with some genuine advantages &mdash; free withdrawals, guaranteed stop losses, a clean interface, and the transparency of a public listing. For experienced CFD traders who want a focused, distraction-free trading environment, Plus500 delivers.</p>

        <p>But for most people reading this &mdash; especially if you are interested in copy trading, long-term investing, or just getting started in the markets &mdash; eToro is the stronger choice. The ability to own real assets, copy experienced investors, and access a social learning environment gives it a combination that Plus500 simply does not match.</p>

        <p>The biggest gap between these two platforms is not fees or spreads &mdash; those are comparable. It is the fundamental difference between a <strong>CFD-only trading platform</strong> and a <strong>multi-asset investing platform with social features</strong>. That philosophical difference determines which one is right for you.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">I should be clear &mdash; I&#x27;m not a financial adviser and this isn&#x27;t a recommendation to use either platform. I use eToro myself and I&#x27;ve found it works for me, but that&#x27;s based on my personal situation and investing style. I have no affiliation with Plus500. Before putting real money anywhere, please do your own research and consider whether it&#x27;s right for you.</p>

        <!-- ==================== FAQ ==================== -->

        <section class="faq-section" id="faq">
  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Is eToro or Plus500 better for beginners?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">eToro is generally better for beginners. It offers real stock ownership, copy trading so you can mirror experienced investors, and a more intuitive social interface. Plus500 is CFD-only, which is higher risk and more complex for newcomers. If you are just starting out, eToro&#x27;s combination of real assets and copy trading makes it the safer starting point.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Does Plus500 have copy trading?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">No. Plus500 does not offer any copy trading feature. It is a pure CFD trading platform with no social or copy trading functionality. If copy trading is important to you, eToro is the only major regulated platform that offers genuine CopyTrader &mdash; automatic, real-time mirroring of another investor&#x27;s trades.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Can you buy real stocks on Plus500?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">No. Plus500 is a CFD-only platform. When you trade stocks on Plus500, you are trading contracts for difference &mdash; you do not own the underlying shares. eToro offers both real stock ownership (commission-free) and CFDs. If owning actual shares matters to you, eToro is the better choice.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Which has lower fees &mdash; eToro or Plus500?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">It depends on the fee type. Plus500 has free withdrawals and slightly tighter spreads on some forex pairs. eToro charges a $5 withdrawal fee but has a longer inactivity grace period (12 months vs Plus500&#x27;s 3 months). For real stock investing, eToro wins because it offers commission-free real shares &mdash; Plus500 only offers stock CFDs with spreads. Overall fee structures are comparable for CFD trading.</p>
