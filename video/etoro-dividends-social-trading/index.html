        <h2 id="how-dividends-work-on-etoro">How Dividends Work on eToro</h2>
        <p>OK, so, how are you actually entitled to get a dividend? How do I actually get it? Do I just have to, sort of, own the stock, and then I get a dividend? Yes, actually, it&#x27;s that simple.</p>
        <p>When you own a stock, you have to own a buy position, alright. So, a buy position, there&#x27;s a difference between a buy position and a sell position. I made a video about short selling, that&#x27;s up here. If you&#x27;re short selling a stock, so betting the price will go down, and hoping to make money as it goes down, on the day of the dividend, you&#x27;ll actually lose more money, so the dividend will go against you.</p>
        <p>So, this is for buy positions, alright. So, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;ve bought a stock. You will be entitled to the dividends, if that company does give dividends. You have to have a specific date in mind, alright.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s called the ex-dividend date, alright. This is the date where a company will take a snapshot of all the people who own that stock, and they will say, alright, these are the people who are entitled to get dividends, when we next give our dividend. Now, where can you find that ex-dividend date? Alright, so, on Etoro, if we go here, let&#x27;s go to Coca Cola.</p>
        <p>Big company, bound to give dividends, stable, been around a long time. So, we go to Coca Cola, and we have the normal thing, feed, stats, chart, research. Over here, we&#x27;ve got the stats page, okay. Don&#x27;t use it very often, but there we are.</p>
        <h2 id="cfd-dividends-vs-real-asset-dividends">CFD Dividends vs Real Asset Dividends</h2>
        <p>Stats page, and down here, we can see that it does show the dividend, and the yield. I&#x27;ll explain what that is in a minute. So, it does show the dividend, but it doesn&#x27;t show when the ex-dividend date is. So, we have to, for Etoro, we have to have bought that stock the day before, or two days before, just before the ex-dividend date.</p>
        <p>And Etoro will then take that snapshot, and it will pay everyone who owns that stock, who has a buy position in that stock, on the ex-dividend date. Now, on other exchanges, it may work slightly differently, you know. They have the ex-dividend date, and again, you have to own the stock before that, and then, just after the ex-dividend date, there&#x27;s the date of record, which is the same thing. They&#x27;ve taken a snapshot, and they know everyone who owned the stock in time for the next dividend, then they can have the payment date later.</p>
        <p>But on Etoro, they&#x27;ve simplified it. We just have to own the stock before the ex-dividend date, and then they will pay us on the ex-dividend date itself. So, where do you find them, if they&#x27;re not anywhere here on Etoro? Now, this is the beginning of 2019.</p>
        <p>Maybe by the time you&#x27;re watching this video, Etoro will show them, but at the moment, it doesn&#x27;t. So, what you can do is, when we&#x27;re looking for companies on Etoro, we can go to Trade Markets, and we can go to Stocks here, and we can search by industry, or by exchange. It&#x27;s quite useful. So, you can just search for exchange, New York Stock Exchange, and you&#x27;ll find all of the equities, all of the stocks and shares that you can buy, which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, okay.</p>
        <p>So, then, you can just go to something like this, a different site, the NASDAQ here. All I typed in is, New York Stock Exchange, dividend, ex-dividend dates, 2019, and I found this. And this shows, look, the ex-dividend date for all of them on the NASDAQ. So, there we are.</p>
        <h2 id="which-positions-qualify-for-dividends">Which Positions Qualify for Dividends</h2>
        <p>It&#x27;s quite simple to find these ex-dividend dates. So, we would have to own it, just one day before. We would have to own the stock in any of these companies, and we would be entitled to get the dividend for them. Alright, so, easy to do.</p>
        <p>Now, how do you find companies which actually do give dividends? How do you know which ones give dividends? Again, I just searched around on the internet, and simple, I searched for, you know, best dividends, or US stocks, New York Stock Exchange stocks which give dividends, 2019. And there&#x27;s all sorts of articles, sort of showing you which ones give high dividends, and good yields, and you know, it goes down here, and it will show you, for instance, AT&amp;T, it gives you a percentage. 7.3% dividend yield, AT&amp;T.</p>
        <p>And then, Philip Morris, 6.8% dividend yield. So, there&#x27;s lots of assistance in, you know, finding which companies are giving dividends, and also finding when the ex-dividend date is. Now, there is someone on eToro, who I&#x27;ll get to later, who&#x27;s sort of made a list of all companies that are on eToro, and he puts out a daily report, a guy called X-Parts, I&#x27;ll talk about him later on, he gives a daily report for people who want to short-term try and trade dividends. But this, for the moment, let&#x27;s just stick to this one.</p>
        <p>So, you can find them, you can find when the ex-dividend date is, so you buy before, and you can find out which companies actually give you dividends. Because not all of them do, not all companies give dividends, you know. And some companies which give dividends now, they may have a bad year, or for whatever reason, they may stop giving dividends in future. It&#x27;s not required, it&#x27;s not a mandatory thing, it&#x27;s purely their own will.</p>
        <p>They&#x27;re not obliged to give dividends, so it&#x27;s up to them. So, if I go back to here, so we know how we can find... Before the ex-dividend date, we know how to find the ex-dividend date. So, let&#x27;s say I go back to Coca-Cola.</p>
        <h2 id="how-to-check-your-dividend-history">How to Check Your Dividend History</h2>
        <p>Coca-Cola, I did it again. So, how much... I&#x27;ll go back to the stats page. How much will they actually give me?</p>
        <p>Alright, so on that other page, we saw the yield, which is this. It gives 3.23%. So, this, here, is the dividend annually, alright. So, what they&#x27;re saying here is that for every one stock you own, one share you own in Coca-Cola, you will get $1.56.</p>
        <p>In this case, it&#x27;s priced in dollars. It&#x27;s a US stock. Here, prices by Exignite in US dollars. It&#x27;s good to check that on everything you do.</p>
        <p>For instance, if we go to a UK one, let&#x27;s go to Burberry, over here. It says, Burberry prices by Exignite in GBX. Now, that&#x27;s not pounds. I thought that was pounds.</p>
        <p>It would say GBP if it was pounds. GBX is pence, okay. So, that&#x27;s £1,819. So, it&#x27;s £18.19 actually.</p>
        <h2 id="maximising-dividend-income">Maximising Dividend Income</h2>
        <p>So, important to look at this to see what it&#x27;s priced in. So, we&#x27;ll go back here. The dividend here, it says, is 1.56. That&#x27;s how much we&#x27;re going to get for each share we own of Coca-Cola.</p>
        <p>So, what&#x27;s the yield? The yield is just, you take the dividend that is quoted annually, you divide it by the current market price, times it by 100 to get percentage, and you&#x27;ll have that yield. So, if I go here, I&#x27;ll just do that quickly. We&#x27;ll do 1.56 divided by 48.27. 0.27 times 100 equals 3.23.</p>
        <p>There it is. 3.23%. So, most people, when they get really into dividends, and looking at them, and which ones are the best performing, which one&#x27;s going to give me the best money, they start looking at the yield, the percentage yield, more often than not. And that&#x27;s the way that they measure, you know, is this going to be good for me. Now, the long-term investors I talked about in the last video, that a lot of long-term investors want stable investments which aren&#x27;t so volatile, and they want to park a lot of their money in those investments.</p>
        <p>And they like these dividends because, you know, they can accumulate over time, and give them cumulative compounding profits, okay. Because they re-plough those dividends back and buy more shares, and it just gets bigger and bigger, over a very long period of time. Okay, so those guys are looking at this yield, you know, to see which one&#x27;s the most desirable, which one makes it most attractive. So, this dividend here, this number, 1.56 per share $1.56 per share.</p>
        <p>Now, US stocks will generally, quarterly, they will pay quarterly. So, every three months, you&#x27;ll get a dividend. In Europe, it can be once a year, or it can be twice a year. In America, it can also be twice a year, or once a year, but it&#x27;s most common to be quarterly.</p>
        <p>Now, if you want to find out about a specific company, and whether it pays quarterly, or whether it pays once a year, or twice a year, unfortunately, you have to actually go and look that up, because there&#x27;s nothing on eToro which actually shows whether it&#x27;s quarterly, whether it&#x27;s yearly, whether it&#x27;s twice a year. You have to look that up, okay. This one here, I&#x27;m assuming this one is quarterly, because it&#x27;s a US stock, but check. When you&#x27;re going to buy, just check.</p>
        <p>Is it quarterly? Is it whenever? What&#x27;s the frequency? This one&#x27;s quarterly.</p>
        <p>So, $1.56, that&#x27;s showing the annual dividend payout, okay. So, to work out what you&#x27;re going to get each quarter, you just take that $1.56, and you divide it by 4. So, 0.25% of that is what you&#x27;ll get each quarter. You get it four times a year, adding up, overall, you get $1.56 per share, per year, which is really quite good.</p>
        <p>Now, obviously, this is geared towards people who are going to buy a lot of shares, you know. That&#x27;s how they make all the money, because they&#x27;re parking a lot more money in there. It&#x27;s not a quick, quick, get-rich-quick scheme. It tends to take a lot of time, you know, and people use more money to invest.</p>
        <p>So, that&#x27;s basically how we get them, and how we know how much they&#x27;re going to give us, and how frequently we&#x27;re going to get that payout. Now, in the next video, I&#x27;m going to talk about how people can trade these short-term, and some of the risks associated with trying to trade these Oni Toro short-term. It was one of the first thoughts I had, you know, why can&#x27;t I just buy this dividend, buy the stock which gives the dividend, the day before, hold on to it overnight, the next day I get the dividend, I&#x27;ll cash out, sell it, close the position, boom, I&#x27;m just making... It&#x27;s like a money-making machine off dividends.</p>
        <p>And there are risks with that, and it doesn&#x27;t quite work like that. And we&#x27;ll go into it in the next video.</p>
