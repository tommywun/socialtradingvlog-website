        <h2 id="in-this-video">In This Video</h2>
        <p>Hey guys, how are you doing? Quick <a href="../../copy-trading.html">copy trading</a> update just to see how the portfolio is doing. A lot of movement, cryptos have been doing amazingly, stocks all over the place, lots of things happening and I quit vaping like a few days ago, vaping and I&#x27;m a bit all over the place, so if I make some mistakes or I seem weird, bear with me, it&#x27;s a difficult process. First thing I wanted to show is, I opened this up and I&#x27;ve got this invested shown here and I sort of mention this every so often, but basically with Olivia Damble, I added a certain amount of money, then I&#x27;ve added more money, then I&#x27;ve taken money out and I&#x27;ve spent it and then I&#x27;ve added some more money and all the rest of it.</p>
        <p>Now if this column says invested, what it&#x27;s showing is it doesn&#x27;t account for the money I&#x27;ve taken out and put in and taken some more out, it just shows the amount overall that I&#x27;ve put in. Even if I&#x27;ve taken some money out, it doesn&#x27;t account for that, it shows the amount I&#x27;ve put in overall, but it&#x27;s not like a real amount. To get to the real amount I&#x27;ve actually invested in him, I just go here and these are all the columns that are currently open. So this is showing all these different column headings here.</p>
        <p>So I go there and I click on invested and this new screen, it just shows me all the different columns I can replace the old ones with. So instead of invested, I&#x27;m going to click net invested, I&#x27;m going to go to the bottom and I&#x27;m going to press apply. And now it shows the real amount, after I&#x27;ve added money to him, then I&#x27;ve taken some money away, I&#x27;ve added more, taken some away, what we&#x27;re left with, the true amount I&#x27;ve invested is $1,000. Now here value shows, what that shows is, if I was to close my trade, my copy of Olivia Danville, right now I&#x27;d have $1,074.28, if I closed it, that would go back to my available balance and I could then withdraw that money.</p>
        <p>So the value is the true amount that I&#x27;m currently copying him with. So if we add $1,000, then there&#x27;s $75.96, so hold on a minute, that should be $1,075.96, why is it not? It&#x27;s $1,074.26. So another thing we can change here, over here it says units, new column heading, I&#x27;m going to go here, instead of units, I&#x27;m going to click units, it&#x27;s the one I want to change, I&#x27;m going to change it to fees and I&#x27;m going to press apply.</p>
        <p>And there we can see that there&#x27;s minus $1.71 in fees and I think that&#x27;s why that number isn&#x27;t adding up. The value is the net invested plus any profit or minus any losses, also taking account of any fees. This is credits, that&#x27;s actually $3.94 he&#x27;s added to me. This is fees minus $1.71.</p>
        <h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2>
        <p>The value is what I&#x27;ll have if I close the copy. Just a quick thing, because people don&#x27;t watch the old videos. There&#x27;s a lot of stuff that I went over in the old videos, which people are continually asking me. I&#x27;m the same, if I watch someone&#x27;s YouTube channel, I don&#x27;t watch the old videos.</p>
        <p>Maybe a couple, two or three of the most recent. Anyhow, Olivia Danville, how&#x27;s he been doing for this month of November? He&#x27;s down 0.04%, just a tiny bit under. Really Olivia&#x27;s doing the same stuff.</p>
        <p>If you look at the numbers each month, you know, he&#x27;s making very, very slow, very small gains. 2.74% for the whole year so far. His risk score, you know, it was up there, it was up before, he&#x27;s brought it down. Average 1, max 1 for the last 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 months, you know. He&#x27;s just going for that entirely low risk, low reward scenario.</p>
        <p>At the moment, he&#x27;s still in the portfolio. I&#x27;m going to shake up my portfolio. I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s going to stay and who&#x27;s going to go, but he&#x27;s still green. It&#x27;s all green months, you know.</p>
        <p>All green months, still the beginning, since 2017, all I can see is green. Still a phenomenal fee, you know. Some people like Olivia&#x27;s style, some people don&#x27;t. Massive amount of people copying him, 8,800 copiers, huge.</p>
        <h2 id="what-tom-found">What Tom Found</h2>
        <p>More than 5 million copy assets under management, but we&#x27;ll see. But he hasn&#x27;t lost anything for me yet, you know. So, there we are. Thank you, Olivia.</p>
        <p>Still trading away, still all in green. Slow and steady over here. He is... A bunch of ETFs, there were those changes in the rules for ETFs where, you know, I used to say that we could, if there were non-U.S. people trading certain U.S.</p>
        <p>ETFs, I think it was, there was a change in it, where we, if we were unleveraged and it was a buy trade, we didn&#x27;t get charged overnight and weekend fees. Yay! So, it was a way to get past, you know, like you could buy the ETF of gold instead of the commodity of gold. You wouldn&#x27;t get those rollover and weekend fees.</p>
        <p>And now, quite a lot of them have switched, and they are now CFDs, and we do have to pay overnight and weekend fees, even if we don&#x27;t use leverage, and it&#x27;s a buy trade on certain ETFs. So, some of them have changed. I don&#x27;t know why. I think it&#x27;s probably regulatory.</p>
        <p>I didn&#x27;t go into that very thoroughly. Again, I just quit vaping. Bear with me. But there we are.</p>
        <h2 id="going-deeper">Going Deeper</h2>
        <p>Slow and steady. How&#x27;s he doing? If we go to stats, he&#x27;s at 7.96 for the year, so it&#x27;s roughly the same as last year. 7.39 last year, 7.96 this year. He had the last two months, he was down just a little bit, 1.71%, which is quite significant.</p>
        <p>Nearly 2% loss, 1% loss, and he&#x27;s sort of making that back this month. Well, technically, I&#x27;ll go over that in another one. I&#x27;ve not quite made it back, but 3.17% so far this month. Doing well.</p>
        <p>There we are. He&#x27;s back in green. Risk score&#x27;s still low. Max yearly <a href="../../video/etoro-drawdowns-copy-trading-risk/">drawdown</a>&#x27;s still low.</p>
        <p>He&#x27;s doing well. How many copies has he got? 1, 9, 9, 0. He&#x27;s down 85 in the last seven days. Whatever.</p>
        <p>He&#x27;ll pick them back up. People seem to be quite fickle, and once they see green, they&#x27;re on board. They&#x27;re not fickle. Momentum trading, you know.</p>
        <h2 id="more-details">More Details</h2>
        <p>If there&#x27;s good momentum and someone&#x27;s making gains, more people sort of seem to jump on board. If there&#x27;s gains and losses, they jump off, you know. It&#x27;s fairly obvious. But, there we are.</p>
        <p>Slow and steady. Doing fairly well there. He&#x27;s at $35 he&#x27;s made me so far. When did I start copying him?</p>
        <p>I started copying him on the 8th of the 5th. January, February, March, April, May. The 5th of this year, okay. So, about five months, yeah, six months, and he&#x27;s made me $35 off $1,000.</p>
        <p>There we go. Anyhow, thank you slow and steady for doing that. Jay Nemesis. Storming away.</p>
        <p>As I said, Jay, as usual, he&#x27;s at $219 profit at this point. Let&#x27;s see what he&#x27;s doing. So, he&#x27;s trading all the same sort of stuff. He&#x27;s in the Bitcoin, he&#x27;s in the Ethereum.</p>
        <h2 id="further-thoughts">Further Thoughts</h2>
        <p>He&#x27;s not... In the past, Jay, sort of, when the cryptos were doing well, was massively involved in the cryptos. Was massively into trading them, and I think he&#x27;s held back, maybe. Ben, if I&#x27;m wrong, correct me, but I think he&#x27;s held back a bit on the cryptos, compared to how much of his portfolio he used to put into cryptos back in the day.</p>
        <p>I think he&#x27;s held back a bit, you know, because, for whatever reason, risk management, whatever. But he&#x27;s still in there, making money on the cryptos. How&#x27;s he been doing at the moment? He&#x27;s at 76%, 76.44% so far for this year.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s unbelievable. The last two months, he was down 0.57% in September, just, just, just a loss. Just a gain, 0.02% in October, and he&#x27;s up at 10.69% so far for this month. That&#x27;s incredible.</p>
        <p>Going back on his stats, his stats are amazing. Going back to 2014, I mean, look at the stats, you know. 2018 was the big, sort of, holding on to crypto, and watching it draw down for a lot of traders. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what got Jay that year. That&#x27;s what got a lot of traders, and maybe that&#x27;s why some of the old guard are slightly more cautious now around it, but I don&#x27;t know.</p>
        <p>But he&#x27;s doing really well, thank you very much Jay. Stunning really. How long have I been copying Jay? So, I&#x27;ve been copying him since the 24th of March.</p>
        <h2 id="the-full-picture">The Full Picture</h2>
        <p>March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, so eight months I appear to have been copying him, and he&#x27;s made me, in eight months, he&#x27;s made 36.64%. It&#x27;s incredible. You know, it&#x27;s an incredible return. Thank you very much Jay.</p>
        <p>Miyoshi has also been doing very well. He&#x27;s on 31. When did I start copying Miyoshi? 23rd of the 9th. January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September.</p>
        <p>So, October, November, only two months I&#x27;ve been copying Miyoshi, and in two months he&#x27;s made me 5.32%. Yeah, 5.32%, because 60 bucks would be 10%. He&#x27;s doing really well. Thank you so much again Miyoshi.</p>
        <p>And he has really just down. Last month he was minus 0.30, and this month he&#x27;s at 4.05%, 66.59% for the year. Huge gains. Thank you very much Miyoshi.</p>
        <p>Still keeping to his style, trading as he does. Baltic Seal has been struggling, sort of up and down, and up and down, in profit, and then back down. He&#x27;s on 4.50% so far for November. He was down a little bit in September, down a little bit in October, but there we are, 4.50% in November. 38.34% so far for the year, 6.98%, just under 7% for last year. 38.34% this year.</p>
        <h2 id="tom-s-conclusion">Tom&#x27;s Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Doing well. This 4.50%, if I look at what he&#x27;s actually trading here, he&#x27;s got a lot of ETFs and stuff, but he did well on Bitcoin. So this Bitcoin trade, he opened it when is it, 10,699, what&#x27;s it at now, 18,000 or something. So he seems to have timed that very well.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s only a small trade, but he&#x27;s made 73% off that trade, you know. Baltic Seal seems to have been struggling a little bit, just these last, well since I started copying him, if it&#x27;s not just me doing bad luck. But he&#x27;s doing really well, 38.34% so far for the year, so he&#x27;s doing well. I&#x27;m getting a warning that my card&#x27;s about to die, so I better get on with this.</p>
        <p>Lombard Earnings. So Lombard Earnings has that strategy where she or the team just basically trade around earnings calls. They buy things before the earnings call, and hopefully the asset will move in the right direction and they cash out and they make money. To be honest, it&#x27;s always just a little positive, just a little negative, just a little positive.</p>
        <p>Out of all the trades, if I go through here, through the history, you know, it&#x27;s sort of win-lose, win-lose, win-lose. The losses tend to sort of wipe out gains made, be slightly bigger, but win-loss, win-loss, and basically, lots of greens there, but then a big sort of red, you see. Lots of greens and a bigger red. And it&#x27;s pretty much neutral.</p>
        <p>I don&#x27;t know what to say about Lombard Earnings there. I started copying on 18th of the 6th, January, February, March, April, May, June. 18th of June, and it&#x27;s now November, sort of late November, and we&#x27;re pretty much at break-even. A little bit, tiny fees, bit of profit. Now this really does go to red, to green, to red, to green.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s hovering around that sort of zero, just neutral balance. So, not sure what to do with Lombard Earnings there, but they&#x27;re doing well. They&#x27;re doing well. I&#x27;m in profit.</p>
        <p>Let&#x27;s see how I&#x27;m doing at the moment. My stats are saying that 3.29% in November, down a little bit last month and the month before. Now last month was up in profit at one point. I was like, yeah, I&#x27;m in green, and it went shot all the way down.</p>
        <p>So will this stay till the end of the month? I don&#x27;t know. We&#x27;ve got like seven days left. Anything could happen.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s been pretty volatile. So I don&#x27;t really trust it until the month&#x27;s closed anymore. But so far, it&#x27;s saying I&#x27;m 4.10% for the year. I&#x27;m in profit for the year, so far.</p>
        <p>Come on! Let&#x27;s end this one in profit. But there we are. Let&#x27;s even end November in profit, you know. 23rd November, who knows what&#x27;s going to happen.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s been all over the place, eh? What a year! And a month! So, let&#x27;s see what happens.</p>
        <p>But I am in profit so far, for the year, and I&#x27;m on average 3, max risk 3. I hope you guys are doing well, and staying safe out there. I&#x27;ve got 2% battery left up here, look, 2%. So I better get off before that goes, and it ruins the whole thing.</p>
        <p>I hope you enjoyed those last videos, sort of about, you know, ways we can potentially lose money and stuff, and risk, and, you know, I kind of want to make that stuff, anything I&#x27;ve found about risk, I want to make as clear as possible, you know. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about, really, just quit vaping. I hope you&#x27;re all well, and I&#x27;ll see you soon. Bye.</p>
