        <h2 id="in-this-video">In This Video</h2>
        <p>Hey everybody, so I just wanted to take a quick break from the <a href="../../popular-investor.html">Popular Investor</a> videos to talk about someone who, here, I&#x27;m thinking of copying. So, I just wanted to go over his profile and sort of analyse it, and kind of get your feedback, and would you copy him or not, basically. So, his name here, now the name, Big Profits, I&#x27;m going to be honest, when I see that name, I think, oh no, I get wary when I see a name like Big Profits, because it&#x27;s the sort of promise that I think people can&#x27;t necessarily keep, but he&#x27;s been doing pretty well. So, his name is Emmanuel de Jesus Bautista Lopez, I think, and there&#x27;s his picture there, looking fairly confident, nice white shirt and stuff.</p>
        <p>So, here we are, look at these. The first thing I see is these statistics, and they&#x27;re all kind of green, which is obviously a good sign. We&#x27;ll go to his feed, though, and just check out what he says about himself. So, he&#x27;s from the Dominican Republic.</p>
        <p>Risk score of 1. 2017, all months green. 2019, trying to repeat it. There we go, he&#x27;s got a sense of humour. Welcome, copy me with all open positions for at least one year to get my results each month without break. Okay, 2018, 4.5%.</p>
        <p>We can look at that in a minute. Minimum copy time, one year. It&#x27;s a long time, but there we go. Recommended copy amount, 10,000 or more.</p>
        <p>I don&#x27;t know, I think he&#x27;s very confident, or I don&#x27;t know, but there we are, 10,000 or more. I&#x27;m not trading cryptos, doesn&#x27;t trade cryptos. I do trade only two to five positions by month, I think per month, but I open positions every month. I&#x27;ve been trading with almost all month in profits since 2015, which is exemplary.</p>
        <h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2>
        <p>It&#x27;s hard to do, there we are. Select copy with open trades at the beginning of the month, and also when my positions of USD, JPY are in red. Otherwise, copy me without open positions. Recommended copy amount is 10,000 to get noticeable gains, but new copiers who don&#x27;t know me yet, and are hesitant, can start with lower amounts.</p>
        <p>So, he&#x27;s saying, there we are, he&#x27;s... I think if he&#x27;s low risk, generally, that means a lower reward as well, even though he&#x27;s called big profits. But, if you&#x27;re going to get, sort of, a lower percentage reward, like 1% a month or less, or whatever, then really, you need a lot of money copying someone for that 1% to actually be an amount of money where people would go, yeah, alright, I like that, I&#x27;m happy. I think that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s trying to say, maybe.</p>
        <p>If he&#x27;s low risk, risk of one... The risk score, really, it doesn&#x27;t just measure how likely you are to lose money, so 1 out of 10, it&#x27;s also how high it will go. So, generally, if the risk is low, the losses will be low, but the profits will also be lower. That 1 out of 10, because I watched that Etoro video on what the risk score really is, it&#x27;s really measuring the volatility of the portfolio.</p>
        <p>So, out of 10, from 0 to 10, 1 to 10. So, that could be a volatility downwards, which would mean losses, which we&#x27;re all trying to guard against, and also volatility upwards, profits, you see. So, they, sort of, go together. Low risk and lower rewards, generally, go together.</p>
        <p>If you want the big, you know, 100% rewards, you&#x27;re probably also risking 100% losses. See how it goes, it measures volatility. Anyhow, so, there we are. Hesitant to go with lower amounts, adding more funds periodically, as long as they&#x27;re happy with my trading.</p>
        <h2 id="what-tom-found">What Tom Found</h2>
        <p>So, he&#x27;s saying he can start off lower, but there we go. Okay, so here&#x27;s his feed, see if he&#x27;s actually talking to people. Really important that traders talk to people. At the moment, someone I&#x27;m copying in my portfolio, MTSNOM, she actually stopped talking to people for a couple of weeks, and she hasn&#x27;t been responding to people&#x27;s questions, and you see everyone panicking really quickly.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s just one of those frightening things, where people think, alright, if she&#x27;s not replying, is she even there? Has this trader disappeared? Have they not got their eye on the ball? Are they going to lose me all my money?</p>
        <p>So, it&#x27;s really nice to see if people do respond, and I always, kind of, check for it. Here, look, that one&#x27;s from 20 hours ago. He is replying, he is updating stuff. That&#x27;s also from 20 hours ago.</p>
        <p>See, it&#x27;s from a day ago. See, he&#x27;s posting stuff. So, he&#x27;s fairly... Look, there we are, 8 days ago, and I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s replying to people as well.</p>
        <p>So, there we are. He&#x27;s active, always nice to see. We&#x27;ve looked at this. At the moment, what does it say? 12,892 followers.</p>
        <h2 id="going-deeper">Going Deeper</h2>
        <p>That&#x27;s people following him, not necessarily copying him. Only 546 copiers. He&#x27;s up 32 copiers in the last 7 days. I&#x27;m going to go to his stats page.</p>
        <p>So, here we are, this is this year. He&#x27;s got 12.85% so far this year. It&#x27;s looking good. Half a percent, half a percent, 2.77, 3.79.</p>
        <p>So, two big months there, relatively. And then, these ones are small. These ones are smaller, but consistent. He&#x27;s in green.</p>
        <p>He was saying he hasn&#x27;t had many red months since 2015. Let&#x27;s see if that&#x27;s true. So, 2015, he made 8%. 2016, he had a big 9% down month on November, but he made 207% in 2016. I wonder if his risk was as low then.</p>
        <p>So, 2017, all green, 34.14%. 2018, last year, he was doing well. Look, all green, all green, then a big loss there. Now, do I take that as one of his patterns? That he&#x27;ll make lots, you&#x27;ll see lots and lots of green, and then he&#x27;ll lose it all.</p>
        <h2 id="more-details">More Details</h2>
        <p>I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m looking at that. But, here we are. He came out of the year at 2.71% because, really, of this month here, July, where he lost quite a lot. So, he&#x27;s lost 9 there, and 8 there.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s a pattern. When I see it, I think I see lots and lots of green, but the green is relatively small compared to that big loss. But, still, 2.71% at the end of the year, and this year, so far, he&#x27;s made 12.85%. So, that&#x27;s 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years.</p>
        <p>I can see 5 years of history with this guy, and he&#x27;s looking pretty good. Let&#x27;s go. Risk scores. Average risk of 1 in the last 7 days.</p>
        <p>Tough to do, there we are. But, there we are. 2 and 4. Average 3. They&#x27;re all really low. 2, 2, 1, 2, 1.</p>
        <p>He&#x27;s underneath my 10% ... 15% yearly <a href="../../video/etoro-drawdowns-copy-trading-risk/">drawdown</a> target. He&#x27;s at 8.90%. That&#x27;s really good risk scores. I mean, it&#x27;s gone up there.</p>
        <h2 id="further-thoughts">Further Thoughts</h2>
        <p>It keeps going up. The max risk has been 5 three times, but he averages 3. And there&#x27;s his copiers again. You can see the graph, it&#x27;s going up, sort of, steadily. 300,000 to 1 million assets under management.</p>
        <p>How does he trade? Mostly currencies, then some stocks, then a little crypto. Although, he says he doesn&#x27;t trade crypto. What&#x27;s going on there?</p>
        <p>But, there we are. Basically, he&#x27;s currencies and stocks, indices, commodities. Average profit is nearly 2. His average loss is slightly more than 2.</p>
        <p>So, that&#x27;s low, you see. Which would make me think he&#x27;s trading more frequently than he says he is, if he&#x27;s taking small profits and small losses, or he&#x27;s got a lot of trades open. An awful lot, I don&#x27;t know. So, there we are. 256 trades, wow, of US dollar, Japanese yen. 51.95% profitable, and his profit&#x27;s bigger than the loss. 172 GBP USD trades.</p>
        <p>So, these are, yeah, Forex trades, and 67% profitable. His average loss is a tiny bit more than the profit. And here, Euro, US dollar, 145 trades. Average profit is much bigger than the average loss. 42.76% profitable.</p>
        <h2 id="the-full-picture">The Full Picture</h2>
        <p>He&#x27;s doing fairly well there. Those are kind of, those are good statistics. The loss is, the profit&#x27;s bigger than the loss on two of them, and on the one where it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s only a tiny bit smaller. His loss is a very small.</p>
        <p>His average loss on each of these is very small off the frequently traded things. That gives me hope that he&#x27;s actually managing risk really quite well. So, 13.59 trades per week, I don&#x27;t know. 3.5 weeks holding time active since 2015. 63.64% profitable weeks. He&#x27;s looking good.</p>
        <p>What are you guys thinking at the moment? At this point, alright, I&#x27;m going to put the thing up over here. Just after this bit, I&#x27;ll keep looking. I&#x27;ll look at his chart, and see what he&#x27;s trading in his portfolio.</p>
        <p>From this, would you copy this trader? There&#x27;s going to be a poll up there, and remember, if you vote in this poll, you can wait and vote on it later when we&#x27;ve looked at the rest of it. But, if you do actually vote on this, it will help the future people who see this video. The people who are brand new, and they think, I don&#x27;t know, what would everyone else do?</p>
        <p>What would everyone else do? Everyone, it&#x27;s <a href="../../social-trading.html">social trading</a>. It&#x27;s part of the thing of Etoro. Part of the joy, part of the beauty, is that we can get the wisdom of the crowd.</p>
        <h2 id="tom-s-conclusion">Tom&#x27;s Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I hope that&#x27;s a thing, but they say, statistically, is people are right, you know. So, I don&#x27;t know. This is not, you know, I&#x27;m not saying copy him. This is not financial advice, and nor is any of the viewers who vote in the thing, but sometimes, it helps to see what other people think, you know.</p>
        <p>So, vote. I&#x27;m going to put it there. Would you copy him? Yes.</p>
        <p>No. Add him to a watch list. Okay, that&#x27;s it. Yes, I&#x27;d copy him.</p>
        <p>No, I wouldn&#x27;t copy him, or add him to a watch list for later. Alright, so I&#x27;m going to carry on. So, let&#x27;s see what is in... I&#x27;m going to check his chart now, just to see the <a href="../../video/etoro-drawdowns-copy-trading-risk/">drawdowns</a>.</p>
        <p>I want to see... Well, okay. So, I go back to the stats, and here, I see we&#x27;re looking from here to here. We should be looking at a year from September to September.</p>
        <p>Now, I don&#x27;t see any really big red months there, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that it doesn&#x27;t go down at some point. So, the fact that you see red, and the reds are small, it might have actually gone down, and then gone up again, but within the same month. So, let&#x27;s say November last year, maybe it went down in November 10%, and then it went up 8%. So, we ended up minus 2%.</p>
        <p>All this would show is minus 2, but we look at <a href="../../video/etoro-drawdowns-copy-trading-risk/">drawdown</a>. Drawdown is how deep it may have gone before going back up. It&#x27;s not necessarily a realized loss. It might not show up here.</p>
        <p>I made a video about <a href="../../video/etoro-drawdowns-copy-trading-risk/">drawdowns</a>, so, if you want to know, but that&#x27;s what I check on the chart. What I&#x27;m looking for here is these things, when it went down, and then back up. So, here&#x27;s the biggest one I can see, which went from 10,257 all the way down to 9,392, which is about what is that, like 8%? 8.5% from there to there. So, I think that is his biggest drawdown of the last 12 months, okay.</p>
        <p>The rest of it, it&#x27;s spiking as the market does, you know, it goes up and down, up and down, but it&#x27;s generally going up. That&#x27;s the biggest <a href="../../video/etoro-drawdowns-copy-trading-risk/">drawdown</a> I see, about an 8% drawdown over there, at the beginning of 2019. So, if I go to his stats now, and I go down, biggest drawdown, there it is, 8.90%. That will have been, you see, that.</p>
        <p>That&#x27;s where I&#x27;m double-checking it. That&#x27;s that <a href="../../video/etoro-drawdowns-copy-trading-risk/">drawdown</a>. So, the chart&#x27;s looking pretty good, you know. Small losses, but they&#x27;re controlled, and wins, small loss, controlled, it&#x27;s controlled.</p>
        <p>This is the biggest <a href="../../video/etoro-drawdowns-copy-trading-risk/">drawdown</a>, and it&#x27;s 8.9%, which is still under my 15% target. Now, if he lost me 8.9% in like a matter of days, I&#x27;d probably still panic heavily, you know, and you&#x27;d see me panicking, but he&#x27;s picked it back up, and he&#x27;s doing okay. So, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking at there, and it tallies with this, so that&#x27;s nice. In his portfolio, let&#x27;s see how much he&#x27;s trading.</p>
        <p>A lot. So, wow, he&#x27;s got a lot open, and I&#x27;m imagining that within each of these, there will be multiple trades. So, this shows the whole thing. How much has he got in Euro, US dollar?</p>
        <p>In all, he&#x27;s got 45% of his total money invested in Euro against US dollar trades. But, if I click into it, it will show, look, there&#x27;s buys, there&#x27;s sells, there&#x27;s buys. The minor trades which are making up his overall exposure to Euro, US dollar, and I&#x27;d imagine that&#x27;s in most of them, you see. There&#x27;s lots of trades within it, but in the portfolio, it groups them.</p>
        <p>So, he&#x27;s got loads in here. Look, he&#x27;s buying, selling, selling, buying, selling, and even in this one, it says he&#x27;s buying. He&#x27;s mostly buying, but there&#x27;s a sell in there as well. You see, he&#x27;s hedging.</p>
        <p>I think he&#x27;s hedging. He&#x27;s trying to control his risk there. Again, it&#x27;s a good sign. People trying to control their risk.</p>
        <p>That&#x27;s how he&#x27;s obviously doing that, keeping his risk low. He&#x27;s got a lot of positions open. Let&#x27;s try and see what the minimum is. 0.23%. See, now I&#x27;m trying to work out how much I have to copy him with, alright.</p>
        <p>And I do that by working out the smallest trade size he commonly uses. 0.22. I made a video about the minimum copying trade size. It&#x27;s $1, so there&#x27;s a way of doing the maths, so I can work out how much I have to copy him with, so that I get all his trades. Watch that video, okay. 0.22% is the smallest I&#x27;ve seen so far. 0.23, 0.24, I think it&#x27;ll be 0.22 if we keep 0.22.</p>
        <p>Okay, and I know that number from when I was doing Harshmith&#x27;s calculation. So, when I was calculating how much I need to copy Harshmith with, so I get all his open trades, his was 0.22 as well. And so, I know that that&#x27;s about $460, okay. Watch the video.</p>
        <p>So, in order to get this guy&#x27;s open trades, I would have all of his future open trades. If his minimum trade size is 0.22%, I have to copy him with $460. Actually, I&#x27;d probably make it $500, to be safe. And then, I know that if he makes a trade using 0.22% of his money, it will make a trade.</p>
        <p>I will automatically make a trade using 0.22% of $500. That&#x27;s over $1, so the trade will open, okay. Watch the video if you&#x27;re in doubt. So, there we are.</p>
        <p>There&#x27;s big profits. The minimum for Emmanuel de Jesus Bautista Lopez. I hope I said that right. Would you copy him?</p>
        <p>Vote in the thing. At the moment, I&#x27;m thinking, yes. I&#x27;m thinking it would be worth giving him a go. However, if I copied him, I&#x27;d have to copy him with $500.</p>
        <p>That would put him over, because at the moment, in my portfolio, this guy, I&#x27;m copying Sealink with $200, $250, $250. So, it would be double this one, and let&#x27;s see... Portfolio... I&#x27;m copying her with $6.6, so it would be about 12%-13% of my portfolio.</p>
        <p>I think I might give it a shot. I&#x27;ll check if it&#x27;s that thing he said about open positions or closed positions. I think I might give it a shot. See what you think.</p>
        <p>Vote in the... Vote, let other people know what you&#x27;re thinking. Put your comments below. If there&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve missed, I&#x27;m going to wait, and I won&#x27;t copy him today.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;ll see if there&#x27;s something I missed. If there is, put it in the comments, and I&#x27;ll read them, and have another look. But, he&#x27;s looking pretty good. He&#x27;s looking pretty good.</p>
        <p>I kind of think, yeah, he might be a good one. So, there we are. I&#x27;ve been aware of him for a while, but I just haven&#x27;t copied him. But, there we go.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;ll carry on with the other videos about the <a href="../../popular-investor.html">popular investor</a> benefits in the next one, and that&#x27;s it for now, and I hope you&#x27;re all doing really well. See you.</p>
