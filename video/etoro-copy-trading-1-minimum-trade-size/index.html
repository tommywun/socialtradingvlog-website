        <h2 id="in-this-video">In This Video</h2>
        <p>Hey everybody, so this one&#x27;s a question I get asked quite a lot, so I thought I&#x27;d make a video just about this one. So let&#x27;s say you&#x27;ve picked the trader you actually want to copy. You&#x27;ve decided, you&#x27;ve analysed this trader, and you think, right, I want to copy this person. You know that the minimum amount on Etoro, at the moment, so it&#x27;s, what is it now?</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s April 2019. At the moment, the minimum you can copy someone with is 200, okay. So you see that, you copy someone with 200, and then you see, you&#x27;ve copied open trades, or you&#x27;ve waited a while, and you see that they&#x27;ve got a certain amount of trades in their portfolio. They&#x27;ve opened maybe 10 trades, and in your copy of them, there&#x27;s only 4 or 5 trades.</p>
        <p>And all of those trades that they&#x27;ve opened in their portfolio, are after the time you copied them. And you&#x27;re thinking, why? Why aren&#x27;t I getting all of their open trades? When you go and see a trader&#x27;s profile, let&#x27;s say I go to one of these, these are the guys I&#x27;m copying in my portfolio.</p>
        <p>I go to ChocoWin, I&#x27;ll go to his, that&#x27;s my copy of him, I click again, and now I&#x27;m on his actual profile, ChocoWin&#x27;s profile. So over here, as we see in the feed, a lot of them put this, you know, recommended copy amount minimum 1000. Why is it different? So the minimum on Etoro is 200, why is he saying 1000?</p>
        <p>If I go to another one, I go to Olivia Danville, let&#x27;s go to Olivia. Olivia says, I do recommend to fully copy me. What does that mean? Fully copy me from $500 with a minimum of 2 months.</p>
        <h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2>
        <p>So he&#x27;s saying $500 to fully copy him, and is that to do with that problem, where they&#x27;ve got 10 trades, and I&#x27;ve only got 2 or 3 open in my portfolio? So there are a couple of things, right. So on Etoro, the minimum we can copy someone with is $200, that will, it will copy them. Does that mean we will copy all of the trades they make?</p>
        <p>Not necessarily. It might do, but it might not. And that&#x27;s because of the minimum trade size on <a href="../../copy-trading.html">copy trading</a>. So with normal trading on Etoro, you can go and you can look in the help section, there&#x27;s minimum trade sizes for everything.</p>
        <p>So if you want to trade equities, it has to be $500, you know, or equivalent value using leverages. Say ETFs is something else, Forex is something else. With <a href="../../copy-trading.html">copy trading</a>, the minimum trade size that can be opened in your portfolio, as a result of a copy, is $1, alright. So how does that work?</p>
        <p>Alright, so we have to work out what the smallest trade size is, that the person you&#x27;re copying will ever make, alright. So <a href="../../copy-trading.html">copy trading</a>, just, most of you probably know this, but what happens is that, here&#x27;s the person I&#x27;m copying, alright. So he makes, he has a certain amount of money in his portfolio, he has 100% of his money in his portfolio. He uses, and he&#x27;s trading with $1,000, alright.</p>
        <p>So what&#x27;s 1%? $10. So he makes a 1% trade, uses 1% of his money on a new trade, and he buys Apple stock, okay. I&#x27;m copying him, alright. I&#x27;ve copied him with $200.</p>
        <h2 id="what-tom-found">What Tom Found</h2>
        <p>He&#x27;s used 1% on Apple. The system will automatically make me make a trade on Apple with 1%. Now his 1% of $1,000 is $10. My 1% of $200 will be $2, alright.</p>
        <p>So we&#x27;ve used different amounts of money. His is 1%, mine is 1%, but his is a $10 trade, and mine is a $2 trade. It doesn&#x27;t copy the same exact money, it copies the percentage of the account used, okay. So if we work that out, alright.</p>
        <p>So let&#x27;s say I have $200 in my <a href="../../copy-trading.html">copy trading</a> account, okay, and the person I&#x27;m copying makes a trade using 1% of his portfolio. It will automatically try and open that trade. It will be a $2 trade, 1% of the $200 I&#x27;ve copied him with, $2. That trade will open.</p>
        <p>Good. It&#x27;s over $1. Let&#x27;s say he makes a trade with 0.5% of his portfolio. Mine will try and make one with 0.5% of the money I&#x27;ve copied him with. 0.5% of $200 is $1.</p>
        <p>Yay! That one will open, hopefully, just, you know. Now what if he makes a trade using 0.49% of his overall money? So Etoro, the system, will go, alright, he made 0.49% trade on Apple, I&#x27;m going to try and make one for you. 0.49% of the $200 I&#x27;ve copied him with is, it&#x27;s like 98 cents or something, it&#x27;s just under $1.</p>
        <h2 id="going-deeper">Going Deeper</h2>
        <p>Boom! That trade just won&#x27;t open. Just won&#x27;t happen. It won&#x27;t be in your portfolio, okay.</p>
        <p>So what we have to work out, so it&#x27;s $200, you can copy him, but there are certain circumstances where if they&#x27;re using very small fractions of their portfolio, their overall account size, sorry, to make trades, it might, when it translates the percentage used, it might be under $1 and not open in yours, okay. So what I like to do is, I like to find out how much, what is the smallest percentage this person I&#x27;m going to copy uses, alright. So one way to do that is, now if I&#x27;m in my portfolio, if I click here into, for instance, Olivia Danville, here I see a trade in oil, alright, there he is trading oil, I can go into that trade, and I can see the amount, alright, I can see the money, but I can&#x27;t see what percentage that is, here. What I have to do is click here on his profile, and go to his actual portfolio, not the copy of him in my portfolio, so here, I go into the portfolio, here I&#x27;m looking at my copy of Olivia Danville, and I can go into that trade, but I&#x27;m still in my copy, okay.</p>
        <p>If I go into my portfolio, I click Olivia Danville, then I click his picture again, now I&#x27;m in his actual, on his page. So if I click portfolio here, it&#x27;s his portfolio, and since eToro can&#x27;t show us how much money other people are using, it shows us, if we click into it, 1.98% overall. Now be careful, because here it says he&#x27;s put 1.98% on oil, but it could be, if we click into it again, there&#x27;s two minor trades, alright, there&#x27;s two sub-trades, which overall, it groups together 1.98% of his portfolio, of his account size, is spent on oil, but if we click in, we see the individual trades, so 0.99%, alright, so he&#x27;s used 0.99%. If we copied in with 200, that would be roughly $2, it&#x27;s basically 1%, it&#x27;s $2.</p>
        <p>Those two would open, alright, so what I usually do, is I have a look at the trade as I&#x27;m copying. I go and I check the portfolio, and I just check, you know, chock-a-win, let&#x27;s go, so not here, we don&#x27;t check here, we go to his actual portfolio, his actual profile, click in his portfolio, so here we are again, 3.97% is invested in this, but again, remember to click on it, there&#x27;s lots of little trades, you see, inside, 1.17%, 1.40%, 1.40%. So we know that anything 0.50%, 0.5% or above, should be over $1, although it&#x27;s getting close, I wouldn&#x27;t leave it that close, I&#x27;ll show you why, but if it&#x27;s over 0.50%, if we&#x27;ve copied in with 200, should get that open trade. So they&#x27;re above it, let&#x27;s go to this one here, 2.34%, 1.17%, yep, we&#x27;d get them.</p>
        <p>This one here, 0.93%, 0.47%, that one there, if we had copied him with $200, that wouldn&#x27;t necessarily open, alright, it&#x27;s difficult. There&#x27;s a way to work this out, and I&#x27;m going to show you it simply, so, I had to look for this, bear with me because there&#x27;s a bit of math, so I go to the calculator, alright, so here&#x27;s how you can work out how much money you would need to copy someone with, depending on what their smallest trade size is. I know that&#x27;s complicated, but bear with me. So, first thing we do, is we put in the number that we actually want to get to.</p>
        <h2 id="more-details">More Details</h2>
        <p>Now we always, in this, we always want to be over $1, so I&#x27;m going to start with 1, alright, then times it by 100, okay. So, that obviously equals 100. We have a fairly simple calculation there. Now all I do, is I divide it by the smallest trade size percentage I&#x27;ve seen him use, so divide by 0.47, alright.</p>
        <p>Now equals, and it shows me the amount of money that I&#x27;d have to use so that 0.47% of it equals $1, and it&#x27;s $212. So if I wanted to get, I&#x27;ll go back to that trade, if I wanted to get that trade that we just looked at in Just.L, in ChocoWin&#x27;s profile, where he used 0.47% of his portfolio, of his account size, on that trade, I would have to be copying him with $212 to get that, so that when I tried to open it in my account, using 0.47% of my money, it was $1 or above. I wouldn&#x27;t leave it that close as $1, I&#x27;d aim for a little bit more, and I&#x27;ll show you why. But, there we are, $212.</p>
        <p>So let me go back to that... Here we are, so 0.47, we&#x27;d have to be copying him with $212, OK. And again, I&#x27;m going to do that calculation one more time, alright, just to show you. So what we do, is we say 1, that&#x27;s the number, the target we want to reach, the $1.</p>
        <p>So 1 times 100, which equals 100, divided by that number that we want to get, 0.47. So what we&#x27;re asking is, what number is it where 0.47% would be $1? Boom, $212, alright. So I had to try and work that out myself, it&#x27;s a bit of a head-twister, but there we are.</p>
        <p>So there we are, over him, it&#x27;s going to need more than $200 to get all of them. You may just want to get the ones which you can get, you know, but most people want to copy all of the trades of the person they&#x27;re copying. So let&#x27;s go and have a look at another one, I&#x27;ll go to my portfolio, let&#x27;s go to Al Naif. So Al Naif here, I&#x27;ll again go to his profile, because I used to get lost with that, and go to his portfolio.</p>
        <h2 id="further-thoughts">Further Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Here it&#x27;s showing 19.17%. Al Naif uses big amounts of his account size on each trade, but remember to click into it and see if there are small ones. Now 9.64%, 9.53%, I&#x27;m going to get those trades if I copy them with $200. So that&#x27;s how we can find out.</p>
        <p>Now, if in doubt, ask them. If in doubt, if you really can&#x27;t work it out, and you really want to make sure you find out what their absolute minimum is. And we find out the absolute minimum they&#x27;ll ever use, because that&#x27;s the worst case scenario. Anything above that, we&#x27;re going to copy, if we&#x27;ve accounted for the absolute minimum of the account size that they&#x27;re going to use.</p>
        <p>I hope you&#x27;re staying with me, I know this is a bit of a thingy, but it&#x27;s fairly simple once you get it, alright. So him, then we&#x27;d get, alright. So all the other ones, I think this one&#x27;s 9.64%, let&#x27;s go into it. 9.64%, he uses large amounts, we&#x27;d be OK there. So with Harsh Smith, for instance, I was going to copy Harsh Smith, and I was looking, and there was a big discussion about this, because people were copying Harsh Smith, and not all of the trades were opening.</p>
        <p>And they were saying, oh, and so they actually asked him directly, what&#x27;s the minimum amount of your account size? The smallest amount you will ever use on a trade, and he said 0.24%, OK. Brilliant, well done Harsh Smith for everyone, helped it all, and he showed people exactly what the smallest amount he would ever use would be. So let&#x27;s do that calculation again.</p>
        <p>So with 0.47%, sorry 0.24% is what he said. So what we do again, is we go 1, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re trying to get, our target amount, times 100, it was 100, divided by 0.24. 0.24 was the smallest amount of his account size he said he&#x27;d ever use on a trade. Equals, it&#x27;s 416. 416, because I&#x27;ve worked this out before myself, you know. So we&#x27;d have to copy Harsh Smith with $416, I&#x27;d actually copy him with 450 or 500, just to make sure.</p>
        <h2 id="the-full-picture">The Full Picture</h2>
        <p>I&#x27;ll show you why. But we have to copy him with that, to make sure we get absolutely all of his trades. Let&#x27;s say, most of his trades might be 1%, some might be 2% of his account size, but sometimes, he may go for a very small trade, the smallest he said he&#x27;ll ever use, 0.24%. We will catch that trade, if we copy him with this amount, or above, OK.</p>
        <p>Now, why do I say I&#x27;d copy him with a bit above, you know? Because... Alright, let&#x27;s go to my portfolio. So, let&#x27;s say Citadel Point, here, who I&#x27;m copying.</p>
        <p>Now, at the moment, it says, net invested $151. Now, yours might say $200, alright, but there&#x27;s profit and loss in that. So, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re copying him with $200, but he&#x27;s made $10 loss, you&#x27;ve now got $190. The value will show that.</p>
        <p>It will show the amount you&#x27;ve invested, minus any loss, or plus any profit, minus any fees, or plus any credits. The value is the amount that it&#x27;s actually going to use to make your trades, alright. So, if that says $190, even if you invested $200, and you think you&#x27;re going to catch every trade, which is 0.50%. If he uses 0.50%, then I&#x27;ve invested $200, so that should be $1, and I should get that.</p>
        <p>But, if he&#x27;s made a loss, and if there&#x27;s some fees, this number, the value, might say $190... $180... $180, if you do 0.5% of $180, it&#x27;s below $1, okay, and it won&#x27;t open that trade for you. So, make sure, maybe give yourself a bit of leeway. Don&#x27;t put it right on the edge, so, I&#x27;ve copied him with $200, his lowest trade is 0.50%, I should be fine. Account for the fact that you might make a little bit of loss, you know.</p>
        <h2 id="tom-s-conclusion">Tom&#x27;s Conclusion</h2>
        <p>So, maybe copy him with $230, $220, you know, if the minimum trade size is 0.50. If the minimum, yeah, trade that he ever does is 0.50, and you work that out, copy him with a bit more, you know. The one with Harshmith, would I copy him with $416, if I know that his minimum trade size will be 0.24%? I wouldn&#x27;t risk it, because what if he makes $10 loss, or something, I won&#x27;t open them.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;d copy him with $450, $500, do you know what I mean? Just to make sure I&#x27;d give myself a little extra room. So, I hope that makes some sense. So, if in any doubt, just ask the trader.</p>
        <p>Ask them what their minimum trade size will ever be, anything over that, you&#x27;ll catch, but try and find out what the minimum is. First I just go through, and I look. I look, and I look in their portfolio, I look here, go, click, go into their portfolio, and check myself. And remember, to not just look at these ones here, don&#x27;t just look at these, just click it, just in case there&#x27;s lots of mini-trades, because it&#x27;s these ones are each individual trades.</p>
        <p>And it groups them together, so we can see quite easily, but you have to check the individual trades. Right. I hope that makes sense. Another reason, just quickly, that maybe they say stuff like, if I go back to my portfolio, Barao, let&#x27;s go to Barao.</p>
        <p>So Barao, he hasn&#x27;t said any minimum requirements. So, some of them, for instance, like those guys we looked at earlier, let&#x27;s go to Olivia Danville. Olivia Danville, in his thing, has said, I do recommend to fully copy me from $500. Now, fair enough, you can work out what you need, actually, to fully copy him, to open all the trades he opens.</p>
        <p>But another reason, I think, some of them also put higher amounts. When you work it out, it might be $200, $250, and you think, look, they&#x27;re trying to steal from me, why are they asking for more? I think some people on Etoro, some traders do just ask for more. They want more assets under management, I know that feeling now, you want more assets under management, because you can potentially make more money as a <a href="../../popular-investor.html">popular investor</a>.</p>
        <p>But also, some of the lower risk traders, when you start off trading, when I started off, obviously I want high rewards, I want, you know, to make a lot of money, kind of quickly, and all the rest of it. But it&#x27;s not realistic, and I think sometimes, if I copy someone with $200, and they make 20% in a year, what&#x27;s that, $40 in a year? Obviously, I&#x27;m not going to be very engaged with that. If I copy someone with $1,000, 10% would be $100, 20% would now be $200, that&#x27;s more useful to me.</p>
        <p>So, I think some of them are trying to, maybe, also set up a system whereby the amount you&#x27;re copying them with, with the results they&#x27;re expecting to get, they think that if they combine the amount you&#x27;re copying them with, with the amount they expect to get, it&#x27;ll be enough to keep you happy. I think some of them are doing that as well. So, instead of saying, copy me with $200, that&#x27;s all you need, they maybe think, well, if I only make 10%, that&#x27;s going to be, what, $20, and he&#x27;s just going to leave. But if I say $1,000, and I make 10%, you know, that&#x27;s $100, that, it may show him that, you know, that&#x27;s worthwhile.</p>
        <p>Not sure what they&#x27;re thinking, I can&#x27;t think for them. Again, not financial advice, you&#x27;ve got to do your own research. But I had that thought as well, and thought I&#x27;d share that as well. So, I hope that makes some sense.</p>
        <p>Still quite complicated, but that&#x27;s the minimum trade size, the minimum trade size for <a href="../../copy-trading.html">copy trading</a> on Etoro. You have to do a little bit of maths, it&#x27;s $1. Anyhow, see you, be well.</p>
