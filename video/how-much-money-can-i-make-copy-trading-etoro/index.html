        <h2 id="realistic-returns-from-etoro-copy-trading">Realistic Returns from eToro Copy Trading</h2>
        <p>Alright, so another question I&#x27;ve been asked, and it&#x27;s another good question, but it&#x27;s got a bit of a tricky answer, is how much money will I make on eToro? People say that. How much money can I make <a href="../../copy-trading.html">copy trading</a>? I&#x27;ll be telling someone about it, and they&#x27;ll say, alright, can I make enough to live off copy trading on eToro?</p>
        <p>And that depends, that really depends on a few things. Let&#x27;s say I go to copy people, which I&#x27;m already in. And let&#x27;s go back to Wesley, because, you know, today&#x27;s Wesley Day for some reason. But, alright, so, when you do a normal job, you work, sort of, let&#x27;s say you work 8 hours, and you work for, I don&#x27;t know, $10 an hour, alright.</p>
        <p>That&#x27;s $80. You&#x27;ve done 8 hours work, $10, $80, that&#x27;s how much I make. So, in a week, you&#x27;ll make, you know, 5 times 8, $400, or whatever you make, you know. There&#x27;s different, you work a certain amount, you&#x27;re getting a certain amount of money.</p>
        <p>So, with this, with trading, it&#x27;s... Let&#x27;s see, alright, so let&#x27;s go to August. In August, here, Wesley made 4% so far. Let&#x27;s do one that&#x27;s close.</p>
        <p>Let&#x27;s do 4, because it&#x27;s a nice round number, and easier maths. Let&#x27;s say he&#x27;s made 4% in August, alright. So, 4% is the amount of percentage. You end up thinking in percentages, kind of for a good reason.</p>
        <h2 id="why-your-starting-amount-matters-more-than-returns">Why Your Starting Amount Matters More Than % Returns</h2>
        <p>So 4% in August. So, let&#x27;s say I have $100 in copying Wesley, 4% is $4, okay. Let&#x27;s say I have $1,000, okay, $1,000, and I&#x27;ve made 4%, $40. See where I&#x27;m going with that? $10,000, $400, 4%, it&#x27;s $400 of $10,000. $400 is 10% of, or 4% of $10,000.</p>
        <p>So, really, different traders will make different percentages, alright. So, you&#x27;re always looking for someone. I mean, he&#x27;s made 83.31% so far in the last 12 months. I go to someone else, let&#x27;s go to Jay, because good old Jay.</p>
        <p>He&#x27;s made 291% in 12 months. Different people, I go back to the copy people bit. Let&#x27;s go to Alex Plesk, he&#x27;s made 114% in 12 months. He&#x27;s made 2.68% in August.</p>
        <p>Let&#x27;s go back, and we&#x27;ll look at this guy here, Reinhard Kohtse. Sorry, I don&#x27;t know how to pronounce your name. He&#x27;s made 0.98% loss in August, but he&#x27;s made 43.16%. So, different traders will make different percentages in different months.</p>
        <p>You can&#x27;t predict how much they&#x27;ll make. What you look at, is you go to someone like Wesley, you look at his previous stats. 2015, he made 7%, 2016, 148%. So far this year, he&#x27;s made 32.99%. See this 83.1% here, that&#x27;s how much he&#x27;s made in the last 12 months.</p>
        <h2 id="what-good-copy-traders-actually-make">What Good Copy Traders Actually Make</h2>
        <p>So it takes in the last 4 months of last year as well, you see. That&#x27;s why those two numbers are different, 83 and 32. So, what you look for with a trader is consistently making money, but you can&#x27;t predict how much they&#x27;re going to make in any given month. You can sort of average it out, you know, you can take the amount they&#x27;ve made in the last 12 months, divide it by 12, and there you go, you&#x27;ve got an average per month.</p>
        <p>So let&#x27;s say 4% is... Let&#x27;s say 5% is an average... Let&#x27;s go with 4, alright. Forget it, let&#x27;s go with 4% is an average that a trader makes.</p>
        <p>So what you have to work out, is how much money... If you want to make a living off it, and let&#x27;s say your living is like, I want to make $1000 a month. I want to make myself $1000, happily. So you&#x27;ve got to work out, how much money do you need to put in, so that 4% extra equals $1000.</p>
        <p>See what I mean? So let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s... With normal jobs, your time makes you money. Your time and your effort makes you money.</p>
        <p>In trading, your money, your actual capital, is what makes you money. The more... If you have 4% of $100, it&#x27;s $4, 4% of $1000 is $40, okay. So both of those people, if someone&#x27;s got $100 in their account, someone&#x27;s got $1000 in their account, they&#x27;re both making 4%.</p>
        <h2 id="the-maths-that-surprises-people">The Maths That Surprises People</h2>
        <p>They&#x27;re both copying Wesley, they&#x27;re both doing nothing, because the system&#x27;s wonderful. He&#x27;s doing all the work, we&#x27;re reaping the rewards, the fruits of their labours, and we&#x27;ve both made 4%. Me over here, with my $100, that guy over there, Freddy, with his $1000. Me and Freddy have both made the same amount of time, we&#x27;ve both made 4%, but I&#x27;ve only made $4, Freddy has made $40.</p>
        <p>He&#x27;s made $36 more than me, for doing the same amount of work. Why? Because he has more money, you know. So, some guy has $10,000 in there, Pete, on the end of the chair.</p>
        <p>Pete&#x27;s got $10,000 in there, he&#x27;s done the same amount of work as me and Freddy. I&#x27;ve earned $4, Freddy&#x27;s earned $40, Pete, with his $10,000, he&#x27;s earned $400. He&#x27;s done the same amount of work. Just because he has more money, he&#x27;s made more money.</p>
        <p>See, we think in terms of percentages, but a percentage is over your overall money. I think that&#x27;s how the rich get richer. Can you imagine the billionaires? This is why I said this, I said, can you imagine the amount of money they make, 4% on a billion.</p>
        <p>I can&#x27;t do the maths, it&#x27;s a lot of money. So, what you have to work out is, if you want to, first you have to find, everyone&#x27;s looking for the traders who make a lot each month, that&#x27;s, you know, kind of common sense. But it also depends on your capital, you know. How much money have you got in there?</p>
        <h2 id="tom-s-advice">Tom&#x27;s Advice</h2>
        <p>So to make, let&#x27;s say you want to make $1,000, and your trader that you&#x27;re copying makes on average, he won&#x27;t every month, sometimes he&#x27;ll lose 2%, sometimes he&#x27;ll make 14%. Yay, good month. So, let&#x27;s say he, on average, makes 4%. You want $1,000 a month to live on.</p>
        <p>How much do you need to copy him with? Alright, so let&#x27;s say you put in $20,000, 10% of that would be $2,000, 5% would be $1,000. Wow, so yeah, if you, 4% it&#x27;s close, let&#x27;s call it that, 4-5%. You&#x27;d have to put in $20,000 for him to, if he was making 4%, $20,000 would get you like $1,000 that month.</p>
        <p>But basically, that&#x27;s it. It depends how much money you actually put in. The more money you put in, the more you&#x27;re going to get back. The more money you put in, the more you stand to risk as well, the more you stand to lose.</p>
        <p>Because if you have, you know, $1,000 in, and he loses 10%, you&#x27;ve lost $100. You have $100 in, and he loses 10%, you&#x27;ve lost $10. Meh... But, that&#x27;s why you try and find people who statistically, actually know how to trade, and consistently make money.</p>
        <p>Even if that amount of money is small, they consistently make money, and when they come to lose money, they know how to stop it. Not like me, who&#x27;s swinging all over the place, but they know how to lose, they know how to stop it, and control, and it&#x27;s called risk management. It&#x27;s incredibly important, you know. So you want to find people who have good risk management, so when they look, he&#x27;s lost.</p>
        <p>Wesley&#x27;s lost in February, 0.92. All the other months, he&#x27;s up. You can be sure that that loss in February would have been much worse, if it had been like a noob trader. See what&#x27;s happened is, Wesley&#x27;s worked out how to set good stop losses.</p>
        <p>How to not use too much leverage. How to not expose himself to too much risk. I imagine, I don&#x27;t know Wesley, if you see this, but I&#x27;d imagine that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on here. So, when his gains are good, he&#x27;ll let his gains go up, and up, and up, but his losses, he&#x27;ll know how to cut them.</p>
        <p>You want to watch for that, but the amount of money you make, all those people who ask me, depends on copying the right trader. A lot of these are very good, all those guys that I&#x27;ve showed you, they&#x27;re all really good traders, but also how much you have in your account for them to trade with. Because in trading, your money is what makes more money. It&#x27;s your great asset.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s not your time. When we&#x27;re <a href="../../copy-trading.html">copy trading</a>, it&#x27;s not even our experience, apart from maybe copying the right person. It&#x27;s not, you know, the fruits of our labour, it&#x27;s not something we build, it&#x27;s something we create. It&#x27;s simply our money.</p>
        <p>The more money you have, the more money you can potentially make. So that&#x27;s that. It&#x27;s a good question, if everyone wants to know... Passive income...</p>
        <p>Hold on, because I&#x27;ve got to say this. Just a quick thing. Even when you think like that, how much money do I have to put in, so that he can make me my 1,000 a month, realistically what you want to do, is because you very quickly work this out when you start trading, the more money you have, the more you&#x27;ll make. Any profits that you&#x27;re making, you really want to leave them in there.</p>
        <p>And you&#x27;ve got to kind of understand that idea, that you&#x27;re going to want to leave those profits in there, so that your account grows, so that you can make even more money. So really in that calculation about how do I make $1,000, really you want to be withdrawing... If you&#x27;re going to withdraw something every month, you want to be withdrawing a fraction of what you&#x27;re actually making, so that your accounts grow. Because as your account&#x27;s growing, then greed can take over, but then basically you can put more money into your account and you can make more money.</p>
        <p>So, the most important thing in the beginning, unless you&#x27;re Pete over there with the billions or whatever, is to actually get your account to just keep growing. <a href="../../copy-trading.html">Copy trading</a> is great, because as you make money in the copy, that money automatically stays in that fund. So, you might start copying someone with $100, and they may keep making money, and that money stays in the account, and then it just keeps adding on. So, the trade side, it&#x27;s like a fund, you know, that money gets ploughed back into the fund, and the trades they&#x27;re making in your name are bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and you can make cumulatively more money.</p>
        <p>So, you&#x27;ve got to think about that. You&#x27;re not going to want to, sort of, just take $1,000 out all the time, because you&#x27;re going to get this... Work this out real quick, and say, hold on a minute, I need to start leaving these profits in there, so that they can make even more money for me. So, yeah, I thought I&#x27;d come back and say that, because it&#x27;s really important.</p>
        <p>OK, I was just editing that last video, and I realised it kind of looked like I was saying just put all your money in, yeah, what&#x27;s the worst that could happen? And the truth is, you know, I wouldn&#x27;t do that. I, you know, I&#x27;ve been with eToro for like 8 months, and do I trust them enough yet to put just all my money in, and you don&#x27;t know. Oh, I&#x27;m not the most trusting of people.</p>
        <p>So far, it&#x27;s gone well. So far, you know, I&#x27;ve put in small amounts, you know, up to sort of $3,000. I trust that so far, I&#x27;m good, and I believe that I can find people to copy who will make, you know, consistent money, people like Jay, or whoever. But would I put all of my life savings in eToro?</p>
        <p>No. You know, if I had $20,000, would I put it all in eToro? No. No.</p>
        <p>I wouldn&#x27;t put all my money in any one thing. So, I just wanted to say that, because, you know, whilst it&#x27;s true that the more money you put in, the more money you make, you know, 5% on $100,000 and 5% on $20,000, you&#x27;re gonna make more money on the $20,000, I still, I still would be cautious, you know, until I know more. I&#x27;ve been working with them for, what, 8 months, so, I&#x27;m still getting used to it, and sort of working my way, feeling my way, and I&#x27;ve got to find out more about the insurance, you know. Someone asked that question, it&#x27;s a good question.</p>
        <p>If eToro fails, goes bankrupt, how much of our money is protected? Apparently, they say $20,000 with Europe, $50,000 with the UK, but I&#x27;m checking into that still. And why is it different between Europe and the UK? Because I&#x27;m with Europe, so, we&#x27;ll see, but yeah, I just wanted to say that.</p>

      <h3 class="faq-q">How much money can you make copy trading on eToro?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">Realistic annual returns from copy trading on eToro range from around 10-25% per year when following lower-risk traders with consistent track records. Higher returns are possible but come with higher risk. On a $1,000 investment at 20% annual return, that&#x27;s $200 per year.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Is copy trading on eToro worth it?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">For most people, copy trading on eToro is worth it as a long-term investment strategy if you invest an amount you can afford to lose, copy lower-risk traders, and treat it as a supplement to your income rather than a replacement. It&#x27;s not a route to quick wealth.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">How much do I need to start copy trading on eToro?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">The minimum to copy a trader on eToro is $200. However, with small amounts the percentage returns translate to very small absolute gains. Tom recommends investing only money you can genuinely afford to leave invested for several years.</p>
