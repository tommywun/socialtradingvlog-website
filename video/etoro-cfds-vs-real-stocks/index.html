        <h2 id="what-is-a-cfd-on-etoro">What Is a CFD on eToro?</h2>
        <p>Hey everyone, so yesterday I was talking about some of the changes that have happened on eToro, and the sort of biggest one, or the one that stands out most that I wanted to talk about, was when you have a buy position in stocks, equities, and it&#x27;s unleveraged, it&#x27;s now the underlying asset that you buy. It&#x27;s no longer a CFD. In the past, everything we traded on eToro was CFDs Contracts For Difference. Basically, it&#x27;s an instrument which is tied to the value of the real asset.</p>
        <p>So, you don&#x27;t buy the real asset, but you buy a Contract For Difference, and it matches the price of the asset. So, if the asset goes up in value, your CFD goes up in value, and then, you know, you sell it and cash out. You make the same sort of profit as you could owning the real thing, but it&#x27;s not the real thing. Now, they changed that.</p>
        <p>Obviously, they changed it for cryptos. Remember, cryptos were all CFDs, and there was a big announcement that we&#x27;re now trading real cryptos, the underlying asset, rather than CFDs, and you know, there was a big thing about that. And, it&#x27;s moved, I believe, to ETFs, and I&#x27;m not sure about the others, but on stocks now, only for unleveraged positions, alright. Unleveraged means when you&#x27;re not, you know, using that x10, x5, x2...</p>
        <p>You&#x27;re not using any leverage to multiply the effect, as though you&#x27;re buying more. It&#x27;s a x1 trade. So, if you&#x27;re selling, short selling... So, if you&#x27;ve chosen that sell button...</p>
        <p>So, here, let&#x27;s say I go to... Let&#x27;s go... First, I&#x27;m going to go into my virtual portfolio, because I&#x27;ve got no money left in my real portfolio to trade with, and I won&#x27;t be able to show you this. So, let&#x27;s say I go to Netflix...</p>
        <h2 id="when-etoro-uses-real-stocks-vs-cfds">When eToro Uses Real Stocks vs CFDs</h2>
        <p>Let&#x27;s say I go to trade... Alright, so here, it always gives you huge numbers... Alright, so, let&#x27;s say x5 leverage on $1,000. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m trading with $5,000, it&#x27;s what leverage does, you know, and then you&#x27;ve got x2, x10...</p>
        <p>They&#x27;re altering this stuff, by the way. Come August, I&#x27;ll talk about that another time. They&#x27;re going to alter the leverage on all the instruments across eToro, to come in line with new European guidelines for trading. I&#x27;ll talk about that later.</p>
        <p>But, so if you sell, you press sell button here, that&#x27;s obviously your short selling. You&#x27;re betting that the value is going to go down, and you want to make money as it does. A buy position, which is the default, it always starts on buy. If I just press...</p>
        <p>I close that, and I just press trade again, it&#x27;s always on buy. You have to, sort of, choose sell, as far as I know, at the moment. So, let&#x27;s say I want to... This is using leverage, I can click that, and do x1.</p>
        <p>Now, I&#x27;m not using leverage. If I do that, I&#x27;ll be buying actual shares in Netflix now. Whereas before, it was still a CFD. Obviously, the difference is on buy positions, in the past, I wouldn&#x27;t get charged <a href="../../video/etoro-rollover-overnight-fees/">overnight fees</a>, if I wasn&#x27;t using leverage.</p>
        <h2 id="key-differences-that-affect-you">Key Differences That Affect You</h2>
        <p>Even though it was a CFD, I wouldn&#x27;t get charged <a href="../../video/etoro-rollover-overnight-fees/">overnight fees</a>. Overnight fees are those little bits of money, I&#x27;ve made a video about it, which I&#x27;ll link to somewhere here. They&#x27;re those little bits of money you get charged daily. Tiny bits, but you get charged daily, per unit, if you use leverage.</p>
        <p>If you don&#x27;t use leverage, you don&#x27;t get charged them. You didn&#x27;t in the past, you still don&#x27;t, but now you&#x27;re owning the underlying thing, okay. If you press sell, it&#x27;s going to be a CFD, even if you don&#x27;t use leverage. If you use a buy position, and you use any amount of leverage, it&#x27;s still a CFD, okay, because that&#x27;s what CFDs are good for.</p>
        <p>They&#x27;re really useful, because they provide leverage, meaning you can, you know, put a thousand Euros, and put times 10, it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re trading with 10,000 Euros worth. So, look, times 1, I&#x27;ve got 2.74 units. If I use times 10 leverage, 27.38 units. You see, it&#x27;s timesed it by 10.</p>
        <p>Now, obviously, with that, there&#x27;s risks. That&#x27;s why a lot of people say CFD trading is risky, and it&#x27;s why I think they&#x27;ve changed it. Now, there are some differences between stocks and CFDs. Stocks, obviously, you don&#x27;t use leverage.</p>
        <p>CFDs, you do use leverage, is kind of the biggest one, and I think that&#x27;s... Alright, so, when you use leverage, obviously, you can make money much faster, but you can also lose money faster, because if the price goes against you, so if you&#x27;re on a buy position, and it starts going down, you&#x27;re going to lose money much faster than if you weren&#x27;t using leverage, because it timeses it by a factor of 10. Times your winnings, and times your losses. So, for new traders, especially, like me, who tend to over-leverage ourselves, we tend to think, alright, I want to make one big score, I&#x27;m going to use lots of leverage, I&#x27;m going to make lots of money, I&#x27;ll take the risk.</p>
        <h2 id="dividends-cfds-vs-real-shares">Dividends: CFDs vs Real Shares</h2>
        <p>It&#x27;s how you end up wiping out your account. A lot of us do that, and apparently 90% of us do that, you know, very quickly. So, what happened is, you remember 2008, there was the financial crisis. Now, a financial crisis, you know, there&#x27;s a lot of...</p>
        <p>People say it was caused by lots of things. It started in something called the sub-prime mortgage market. Sub-prime meaning, it&#x27;s not prime. There&#x27;s many words you can use instead of sub-prime.</p>
        <p>They&#x27;re not the best... Not the best mortgages. They&#x27;d been rated as though they&#x27;re worth this much, and really, these ratings were false. They were worth this much.</p>
        <p>So, the valuation simply disappeared, and there was a lot of speculation. A lot of people were massively over-leveraged, had, you know, five mortgages, and couldn&#x27;t possibly pay back these loans. Anyhow, after that, America, the US, I believe it was then, check it, but I believe it was then, banned CFDs, because it&#x27;s a form of derivative, alright. A derivative is, it&#x27;s not the real thing you&#x27;re trading, it&#x27;s not the real stock.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s something tied to the value of that, which speculates on it, you know. Watch the big short. Great film, and it will explain derivatives with that, you know, woman in the bath. It&#x27;s a good film.</p>
        <h2 id="which-should-you-choose">Which Should You Choose?</h2>
        <p>Watch the big short if you want to understand a bit more about that, or there&#x27;s many places to learn. Just look up derivatives, and anyhow. So, US banned CFD trading. So, eToro couldn&#x27;t get into the US market, and hence, you know, if you&#x27;re an affiliate, on my affiliate screen, it sort of says, you cannot promote this in the USA.</p>
        <p>Big, bold exclamation right on the front. So, USA couldn&#x27;t use eToro, you know, people there can&#x27;t use it. I think Canada as well, Brazil, I think Japan, Belgium. Not sure why Belgium, but there we are.</p>
        <p>They banned CFDs, and the US, at least, said that they banned derivative trading because they didn&#x27;t want, you know, they sort of blamed all derivatives for the 2008 financial crisis. Whether that&#x27;s true or not, I don&#x27;t know, but that&#x27;s what they did. So, what happens now? So, the second I heard that someone told me, you know, quite a while back, he told me, as I said, he told me in private, this guy who&#x27;s one of the heads of marketing, or something, of eToro, and he said, you know, we&#x27;re gonna move more and more to the real underlying assets.</p>
        <p>Didn&#x27;t make a video about it, because, you know, it was said in... I thought, maybe, he said it in private, and didn&#x27;t want it that announced, so, you know, I wasn&#x27;t going to sort of betray that. But, you know, it didn&#x27;t make much difference anyhow. The first thing I thought was, they can move into the US market, because if they&#x27;re trading the underlying assets, and not CFDs, you know, that&#x27;s going to open up a huge new market for them.</p>
        <p>Anyhow, so, I got the email, there we are, there was a thing on their blog, which I hadn&#x27;t actually read, but there we are, I got a notification about a stock investing with eToro. Up until now, clients could invest in stocks via CFDs, however, now, clients will have the option to purchase the underlying asset. As of 1st May 2018, there we go, and it lists some of the advantages and disadvantages, and how to buy them. You can look up the differences between stocks and CFDs, there&#x27;s some changes in stamp duty that you have to pay in the UK, I&#x27;m not sure about other countries, but basically, there are some differences, but they&#x27;re not that huge.</p>
        <p>The main one, they are, I guess, you know, but they&#x27;re... You can still make money off CFDs, and off buying the underlying asset in the same way. It&#x27;s not like you make more money off one, and less off the other. We used to get paid dividends, even on the CFDs, you get, obviously, paid dividends on the real asset.</p>
        <p>I don&#x27;t know, there might be a difference in that, but there we are. So, this came out... So, when was this? This was May the 3rd 2018, and then, another one, May 16th 2018, boom! eToro announces new crypto exchange, it&#x27;s massive.</p>
        <p>A mobile wallet, which we knew they were working on, anyhow, and US expansion. And honestly, I think that might be the major reason that they&#x27;ve gone through with this. There are differences in how we trade, but, you know, you didn&#x27;t pay <a href="../../video/etoro-rollover-overnight-fees/">overnight fees</a> on unleveraged CFD stock positions, so that would be good for long-term. If you&#x27;re going to trade an asset, a stock, long-term, and you just want to leave it there, and you don&#x27;t want to pay overnight fees, and you don&#x27;t want to pay weekend fees, you could just not use leverage, and you wouldn&#x27;t for buy positions in the past.</p>
        <p>With stocks, obviously, that&#x27;s the same. I can&#x27;t see a great deal of difference, but I think it might just be mostly a business decision, so that the US expansion can take place. Which is huge, because that&#x27;s, you know, millions more potential people using eToro. That&#x27;s very big for them.</p>
        <p>Another quick thing about this, about... Okay, so, trading... Just another thing which I&#x27;ve noticed they did, is there&#x27;s a lot of people comment about removing the take-profit, and removing the stop-loss, and why can&#x27;t we do that entirely? And you can now, as long as it&#x27;s...</p>
        <p>Now, if I&#x27;m here, I&#x27;m buying Netflix, over $1,000 worth of Netflix, and... So, if I&#x27;m using leverage, there&#x27;s stop-loss, and it&#x27;s the same as it always was. Take-profit, the same as it always was. If I click this, and go to x1, unleveraged position, which would now be the real underlying asset.</p>
        <p>See, you are buying the underlying asset. x2, CFD trade. So, these are all CFD trades. x1, you are buying the underlying asset. If I click stop-loss now, I can either set the stop-loss as I would before. I can set it as an amount, as a rate, I can do a trailing stop-loss, or no stop-loss.</p>
        <p>Stop-loss gone. So, once you&#x27;ve lost 100% of the money you invested, it&#x27;ll, I think, cancel you out. I&#x27;m not sure about that. You used to be able to extend your stop-loss beyond 100%, by adding, using up some of your available-to-trade margin.</p>
        <p>So, down here, in my portfolio, I&#x27;d have a certain amount, which is always not in trades. Here, 71,752. That&#x27;s my available margin, they call it. The available money I can use to trade.</p>
        <p>And it used to be, that I could, sort of, use that up, and extend beyond 100%. I could actually just, you know, extend it to, you know, whatever. But, I think that&#x27;s actually gone now. So, if I go back to trade, and I go back to x1, I can go on my stop-loss, and simply disable it.</p>
        <p>So, do you know what? And I can do it with the <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a>. So, stop-loss, once I&#x27;ve lost 100% of it, it&#x27;ll just close the trade. I believe, I don&#x27;t think you can lose more.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;ve never been in that position. If someone has lost more, please let me know. Then they&#x27;re 100%, please let me know. But, I don&#x27;t think so.</p>
        <p>I think it&#x27;ll just stop you out, when you&#x27;ve lost all your money. Same with the <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a>, I can set no take profit, which is quite useful, because it means you don&#x27;t... In the past, you had to, sort of, go into your take profit. When the trade was open, you&#x27;d go into your trade, and adjust your take profit upwards, because it was always as a proportion of your money.</p>
        <p>Now, you can just get rid of the <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a>. Now, obviously, I can only do that, if it&#x27;s an unleveraged position. I can&#x27;t do that. The second I start using leverage, that&#x27;s gone.</p>
        <p>The get rid of <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a>, and the get rid of stop-loss is gone. So, let&#x27;s say I do that. Times 1, I get rid of my stop-loss, I get rid of my take profit, let&#x27;s open the trade, right. So, it&#x27;s a Netflix trade.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;ve opened it, so that trade is now live, because the US markets are open, I believe, I think. Let&#x27;s go to my portfolio, let&#x27;s see if it&#x27;s in order, or if it&#x27;s live... There it is, Netflix. Boom, boom, boom.</p>
        <p>So, that&#x27;s live. Now, I can go into that trade. So, once it&#x27;s open, can I change it? Can I set a stop-loss, or a <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a>?</p>
        <p>If I&#x27;ve previously unset it, yes. I just go into the stop-loss, and I can click here, set stop-loss, and I can set it wherever I want. So, there we are, let&#x27;s set it at half, 50%, 500, and I can update it. So, there&#x27;s now a stop-loss in, I can do the same to the <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a>.</p>
        <p>So, you can set <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a>, and let&#x27;s go to take profit, there we are, 1000, update, and so you can alter it once the trade is active. So, that&#x27;s quite nice. So, basically, I think the change to the underlying assets is mostly to do with entering markets where CFDs are banned. It&#x27;s a very sensible business move, you know.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;m sure there are other differences, you can read about them, go and read about the differences between CFDs and equities, and a lot of people got freaked out by CFDs. There used to be a lot of people, because they&#x27;re associated with the kind of gambling mentality a bit, or they&#x27;ve got a bad name after 2008, and there was a reputation because new traders would use them, and they would use too much leverage, open up, you know, expose themselves to far too much risk, and you can wipe out your account really easily doing that. So, they were kind of frowned upon in that way. I think in the US, people got around the lack of CFDs by using options.</p>
        <p>Options traders could use leverage, they just moved somewhere else and did the same stuff. Except, options are time dependent, so you have to bet that it will be at this value, by this time. It&#x27;s a different data, they call it, a different variable. Anyhow, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on with us, with stock.</p>
        <p>So, there might be a lot of Americans getting on board, all of a sudden, and stuff like that, and in that press announcement, yeah, it does... It doesn&#x27;t say when, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s live in the US now, or I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s going to be... I mean, this stuff about how they&#x27;re going to announce a new crypto exchange, that&#x27;s huge. That&#x27;s huge, they&#x27;re going to launch a crypto exchange.</p>
        <p>Very useful article, this one. A lot of nice stuff. A lot of nice stuff in their blog. I think I&#x27;m just going to do, like, an eToro news thing, and just go through some of the interesting posts in their blog, because I never read it, and there&#x27;s some good stuff in there.</p>
        <p>So, that&#x27;s it. There&#x27;s a change, a bit of a change there, and you can get rid of your stop-loss and your take-off. I think that&#x27;s it. I&#x27;ll leave it there for now, and I&#x27;ll be back with the news, I guess.</p>
        <p>See you.</p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Do you actually own stocks when you buy them on eToro?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">It depends. Non-leveraged Buy positions in stocks are held as real shares — you actually own the underlying asset. Any leveraged position, short position, or non-stock asset is held as a CFD, meaning you own a contract tracking the price but not the asset itself.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">What is the difference between a CFD and a real stock on eToro?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">A CFD (Contract for Difference) lets you speculate on the price of an asset without owning it. It can be leveraged, can go short, and incurs overnight fees. A real stock gives you actual ownership, qualifies for dividends, and has no overnight fees — but cannot be leveraged or shorted.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">How do I know if my eToro position is a CFD or a real stock?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">Check the leverage setting on your position. If leverage is set to x1 and the position is a Buy, it&#x27;s a real asset. If any leverage above x1 is applied, or if it&#x27;s a Sell (short) position, it&#x27;s a CFD. You can also see this in the position details in your portfolio.</p>
