        <h2 id="in-this-video">In This Video</h2>
        <p>Hey guys, so I just wanted to talk about something quickly. Every so often I get these sort of comments on my channel, like this one here. Best thing I did was pull my money from <a href="../../copy-trading.html">copy trading</a>, do it yourself and instantly made 60% gain on Amazon, 60% mind you, 65% on Google and 10% up on ETFs. Do your own thing.</p>
        <p>So much better than these copiers. I mean, that&#x27;s fantastic, isn&#x27;t it? And then look, yeah, 100% agree and I&#x27;m starting to think the same. Now these guys, I don&#x27;t want to single out, these guys have got a really good point, right?</p>
        <p>But I think you should go further than that. If you can make 60% gain on Amazon, 65% on Google, 10% up on ETFs and it&#x27;s quite easy for you, become a <a href="../../popular-investor.html">popular investor</a>. What are you doing? If there&#x27;s any way I could be a popular investor, do you know how much money those people are making on this site?</p>
        <p>Let&#x27;s have a look at one of them here. Okay, so here&#x27;s Jeppe Kirkbond who I talked about in one of the last videos. Now granted, he says he&#x27;s the most copied <a href="../../popular-investor.html">popular investor</a> on eToro with 20,000 plus investors copying him with over $50 million, all right? So this guy&#x27;s got a lot of people copying him.</p>
        <p>Okay, so this page here is the <a href="../../popular-investor.html">popular investor</a> page on eToro. This tells us all the information about the popular investor program, how to get onto it and what sort of rewards we can get, how much money we can make if we are popular investors. So let&#x27;s have a look. So here we can see that the cadet, the first level, doesn&#x27;t get a monthly payment.</p>
        <h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2>
        <p>If you&#x27;re a champion, you move up to the second level, you can get $500 a month. And then elite and elite pro, which is where Jeppe Kirkbond is, they both get 1.5% of the annual assets under management. You get more if you&#x27;re actually elite pro, 1.5% of the assets under management. And actually what it is, is the first $30 million, if he&#x27;s been there for over five years on the site, which Jeppe has, up to the first $30 million of assets under management gets 1.5% of that per year, split into 12 monthly payments.</p>
        <p>And he gets 0.5% on the other 20 million plus, because he&#x27;s got 50 million plus. But let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s 50 million. Let&#x27;s do the maths on that. Okay, so 30, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, times 1.5% equals $450,000, $450,000.</p>
        <p>And let&#x27;s divide that by 12 monthly payments. So how much is he going to be getting on that a month? That&#x27;s $37,500, $37,500 a month right there. All right.</p>
        <p>Now remember there&#x27;s the other 20 mil, not a lot, just an extra other 20 mil. So let&#x27;s work that one out. Times 0.5%, because he only gets 0.5% on the other 20 mil, that&#x27;s another $100,000. So what&#x27;s that? $550,000 per year.</p>
        <p>So let&#x27;s divide that by 12, all right, equals $8,333. So what was he making before? $37,000, now another $8,000 a month. It&#x27;s incredible how much money. That&#x27;s a month.</p>
        <h2 id="what-tom-found">What Tom Found</h2>
        <p>All right. Then he&#x27;s got his actual trading profits. He&#x27;s putting 9.57, so he&#x27;s made 9.57% this year on his money. Plus he&#x27;s getting that 37, what is that, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 45-ish thousand a month.</p>
        <p>So he&#x27;s putting more, because he says 50 million assets under management. It could be more than that. On the stats page here, it only ever says 5 million plus copy assets under management here. We can see that 50 million is obviously a lot more than that.</p>
        <p>A place where we can see exactly how much the people we&#x27;re copying have is on that monthly investors fact sheet. But we only get that fact sheet for people we&#x27;re copying. So I&#x27;m not copying Jeppe, although I might start, because really looking at the statistics, look how well he has done. Now we can see why, if you look at these statistics, why people have, so many people have copied Jeppe.</p>
        <p>He does a thorough job and he does really well, but let&#x27;s go back and look at the portfolio over here. We look at someone I&#x27;ve just copied, like Isabee over here. Now looking at Isabee&#x27;s statistics, again, what she&#x27;s got is consistency, right? So she&#x27;s got these many years, she&#x27;s got three years where she&#x27;s been consistently profitable, but they&#x27;re really small amounts.</p>
        <p>Look, 0.44, 0.55, 0.56, looking at this last month, okay, I go to the history and I look at the last month, last 30 days. She made one trade, opened on the 5th of the 9th, closed on the 6th of the 9th. She basically held it for a day, made 2.17%. That was it for the month.</p>
        <h2 id="going-deeper">Going Deeper</h2>
        <p>See, Isabee over here only has 317 copies. She hasn&#x27;t got the 20,000 plus that Jeppe has, but look at that line. Look at it. Is it going up?</p>
        <p>Is it going down? Is it going flat? It&#x27;s going up. Okay, it&#x27;s going up.</p>
        <p>So you can be an Isabee and you can have sort of this style, or you can be a Jeppe Kirk Bond and you can have those big, or you can be something in between, or another one. You can be yourself and have those big returns. Many people want bigger returns. That&#x27;s always incredibly sort of attractive, but steady gains, reliability, as you saw, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for, consistency.</p>
        <p>You see, I don&#x27;t have that temperament. I&#x27;m a gambler. I tend to gamble. I tend to, if I make 0.5%, I&#x27;d want to make 1%, and then I&#x27;d want to make 2%, and then I think I can make 5%, and then I want to, do you know what I mean?</p>
        <p>That&#x27;s the problem. You have to have discipline. Now, if you spend all your time watching charts already, and you know about the fundamentals of companies, and you&#x27;re interested in this, and you do this naturally, then good lord, I think this is an amazing business opportunity to just keep doing what you&#x27;re doing, and start getting copies, and start making those big bucks. I mean, I&#x27;m tempted, because I have a YouTube channel.</p>
        <h2 id="more-details">More Details</h2>
        <p>I have like 63,000 subscribers. What&#x27;s stopping me from just trying to sort of mimic something like what Bee&#x27;s doing here, and get like small statistics, one or two trades a month, get people in, all these people watching. I could maybe try and convince them to try and come and copy me. Okay, no one is going to come and copy me if I&#x27;ve got all red statistics.</p>
        <p>If I wanted to do this and attract people, it doesn&#x27;t matter how many subscribers I have, or how many people think, oh, Tom&#x27;s an alright guy. People are here for money, so you have to know how to trade. Now, knowing how to trade, you have to learn the technical analysis, you have to learn the fundamental analysis, you have to learn about the markets, learn your sector of the markets. Both Jeppe and her will understand their part of the markets, the assets they like, and they will trade them.</p>
        <p>They will understand how to trade, but it&#x27;s more than that, and it&#x27;s the reason why I&#x27;m not trading. At one point, I was a <a href="../../popular-investor.html">popular investor</a>. They used to let me do that, and then they changed the law, and they said, you can either be a popular investor and only manually trade, or you can continue to copy people, but you can&#x27;t be a popular investor. I chose to not be a popular investor and just copy people.</p>
        <p>Why? Because if you look at my first years of trading results, my first four months, five months, it&#x27;s me losing 48%, trading gold first thing in the morning, highly leveraged before I&#x27;m even awake. Second year, I made gains. It was just luck.</p>
        <p>I was gambling. Third year, you see me down again. I don&#x27;t have that discipline, and not because I couldn&#x27;t, I could study and learn how to trade technically, but you&#x27;ve got to deal with your emotions. What about your fear?</p>
        <h2 id="further-thoughts">Further Thoughts</h2>
        <p>What about your greed? Would I be happy to make half a percent, or would I start chasing 1%, 2%, higher percents? What happens if I made a loss? Would I be able to accept that loss?</p>
        <p>Would I mind if you saw my losses, or would I always want to look green, and would I chase that and start taking bigger and bigger risks and eventually land in trouble? And it&#x27;s one thing to do this when no one&#x27;s copying you. Can you imagine, in Yepez&#x27;s situation, having $50 million of other people&#x27;s assets copying your trades? If you make a trade on Apple, you&#x27;ve got to wonder, if this loses, it&#x27;s not just me who&#x27;s going to lose, all those other people.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;m going to lose $50 million under management, all of that money. How much am I going to lose if this trade loses? How are people going to respond to me? Are they going to be angry?</p>
        <p>I get bad comments sometimes on this channel. It&#x27;s difficult when people aren&#x27;t nice to you, or to just do stuff in public, because you know, whatever you do, also, one of the reasons I don&#x27;t manually trade, which is a bit sad, but also true, all of my trades will be heavily scrutinized. But if I make a mistake, I&#x27;ll have 64,000 people going, gotcha. Imagine if you&#x27;re a <a href="../../popular-investor.html">popular investor</a> with $50 million assets of other people&#x27;s money under management, what&#x27;s it going to be like if you start making mistakes, if you have a down week, or a down month, or a down three months?</p>
        <p>Could you handle that? There&#x27;s a lot that goes into this, which is more than just the technical aspects of trading and that knowledge. There&#x27;s an emotional component to harnessing your emotions and controlling them, A, so that you can do this effectively and trade effectively, because emotions get in the way, and you make terrible decisions when ruled by emotions. Me, and a lot of other people.</p>
        <h2 id="the-full-picture">The Full Picture</h2>
        <p>But apart from that, if you&#x27;re a <a href="../../popular-investor.html">popular investor</a>, and you&#x27;ve got all those people copying you, can you harness and handle your emotions when things go wrong, or when things are going right? Can you not become too arrogant and too sure of yourself? A lot that goes into this. For those who can do it, the rewards are huge, though.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;m tempted to try again. I&#x27;m tempted to start a second account and try, can I do it now? Do I have enough mastery of my emotions, and enough knowledge to make these sort of gains consistently so that maybe I can earn, and you&#x27;d have to earn. No one&#x27;s going to give you that trust just because they like you.</p>
        <p>You have to earn it with consistency to have people copy you. But I think for those who can do it, the rewards are incredible. Maybe it&#x27;s worth a shot, we&#x27;ll see. Anyhow, that&#x27;s it for now.</p>
        <p>For all of you trying to sort of be on the <a href="../../popular-investor.html">Popular Investor</a> Programme, good luck to you. I hope it goes really well. Alright, see you in the next one, bye bye.</p>
