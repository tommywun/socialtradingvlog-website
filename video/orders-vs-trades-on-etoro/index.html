        <h2 id="in-this-video">In This Video</h2>
        <p>Hey, so another question I&#x27;ve been asked is what&#x27;s the difference between a trade and an order on eToro? And it&#x27;s really quite simple, there&#x27;s a few things which are a bit technical but really it&#x27;s a simple thing. So whenever you buy something on eToro, you&#x27;re normally buying it, you see the price listed on the page, so if we go to Bitcoin, let&#x27;s go to Bitcoin because that&#x27;s been doing well, so here we see the normal price, that&#x27;s how much we normally would buy Bitcoin for. Here&#x27;s the trade button, used to that.</p>
        <p>When we go to the trade button, say we want to buy some Bitcoin. So obviously if you&#x27;re buying it means you&#x27;re betting the price is gonna go up, and if you want to sell it means you&#x27;re betting the price will go down, you want to make money that way. So normally we see this thing, here&#x27;s the price, now we see that the buy price and the sell price are different, that&#x27;s the <a href="../../video/etoro-spread-fees-explained/">spread fee</a>, so when I press those buttons you see this number changing now. But normally when we open a trade, we expect to open the trade instantly, okay I want to buy it right now, I don&#x27;t want to wait, I don&#x27;t care how the price is gonna change I do, it&#x27;s not gonna change, I don&#x27;t care how the price is gonna change, I do, but only in future.</p>
        <p>I want to buy it now and that&#x27;s my kind of bet is placed. Now over here we see the button which says trade. If we click on that button we can see that there&#x27;s another option which is order and this is some people have asked what&#x27;s this about. Really basically all it is is that an order is that you when you select order you can set a price that you want to buy it at or if you&#x27;re selling that you want to sell it at.</p>
        <p>Doesn&#x27;t have to be the price it&#x27;s that now. Okay so you&#x27;re putting an order in let&#x27;s say I want to buy it I think the bitcoin is going to go down below 8,000 let&#x27;s say. So I want to set an order at 8,900. Okay so I can do it here.</p>
        <p>I can specify any level any price that I actually want to buy it at which isn&#x27;t the one where it is currently. That&#x27;s basically all an order does. Now we&#x27;re kind of used to using orders but when you set up a trade and you start a new trade you often set a <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>. So a stop loss is actually an order.</p>
        <h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2>
        <p>It&#x27;s a <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> order. What you&#x27;re saying is that if it ever gets to this predefined level cancel it sell close the position sell my trade I want to get out of it. Same with the <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a>. When if I go into any of my trades here in the portfolio it&#x27;s my virtual portfolio.</p>
        <p>Here&#x27;s my <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a>. So the take profit is saying if it ever gets to 396.29 close the trade and I want to get out of it. That&#x27;s a type of order. Okay so a take profit is an order.</p>
        <p>A <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> is an order. But with all trades it automatically asks you if you want to set those up because one&#x27;s for security and one&#x27;s to take your profits. So even though <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a> and stop loss are actually orders they&#x27;re very different from what we&#x27;re talking about when we say what&#x27;s the difference between trade versus an order. I just kind of wanted to give the fullest information about what an order is and so that people can understand we can understand that we just we use them anyway.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s not like some mysterious thing. Now <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a> and <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>. Here I am on Zendesk. If I press trade here&#x27;s the take profit and here&#x27;s the order.</p>
        <p>Here&#x27;s really what we&#x27;re talking about at market and order. So the <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a> and <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> they&#x27;re not called orders on eToro. Okay so it&#x27;s a bit confusing if I say that if I even call them orders because people might get confused. When we talk about orders we&#x27;re talking about these things here where we want to buy into a stock or an asset at a particular price.</p>
        <h2 id="what-tom-found">What Tom Found</h2>
        <p>These ones the <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a> and <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> they both deal with when we want to exit a trade at a particular price. Okay so those are orders. To exit a trade but we don&#x27;t call them orders. So you won&#x27;t find them up here.</p>
        <p>You can&#x27;t set your <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> from the order bit. Whenever you start a trade you&#x27;ll see your <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a> is here and your stop loss is there. Anytime if we&#x27;re in a trade and it&#x27;s already active we can go to our portfolio and we can go to any trade and here&#x27;s the stop loss and take profit and we can just click on it and we can edit that even whilst the trade is active. Okay so those orders they&#x27;re different.</p>
        <p>Okay they&#x27;re to exit a trade. So we can exit a trade and eToro puts them there so that we have some security so that we have a time where we can either take the profit because we&#x27;ve made as much profit as we want or we think we can make and we want to get out of the trade we want to close the trade or <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> because we&#x27;ve lost as much money as we want to lose we&#x27;ve predetermined that and it gets us out of the trade they&#x27;re both to get out. The orders we&#x27;re really talking about are actually the ones when we want to get into a trade. So it&#x27;s it&#x27;s these ones here it&#x27;s that.</p>
        <p>So that one if you&#x27;re on a stock you can find it there and if you&#x27;re on a anything else other than a stock you can find it here. Okay I don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;ve done the difference made it different on stocks and other assets but they are. With the rest of them when you&#x27;re setting a new trade so we&#x27;ll go back to Bitcoin that&#x27;s basically all it&#x27;s doing is it&#x27;s saying I don&#x27;t want to buy it at the current market value this what we&#x27;re normally doing here when we buy a sell is actually known as an at market order. Or a market order but we don&#x27;t have that we just have a buy button or open trade button as standard the default is actually a market order.</p>
        <p>This is actually called the limits order when we set it as as an order but here it&#x27;s just called order to keep it simple when you select order you can set any price you want and there we are and you can set the order at eight thousand boom boom boom so there we are eight thousand and I set the order okay now that is gonna stay open so if I go here I&#x27;m back in my portfolio see this button shows my history the history of my trades this is my portfolio this one will show any orders so there it is there&#x27;s my order that&#x27;s how much I invested I&#x27;m gonna execute it at 8 000 and it&#x27;s currently here all right now there are different types of orders you can set in other sites you can set them you know it has to be filled by the end of the day or get rid of it it has to be filled within so many minutes or get rid of it this one is actually in other places it&#x27;s known as a good till executed I can&#x27;t remember whatever basically the orders we have here will stay open until they&#x27;re fulfilled and they might not be fulfilled it might not go down to 8 000. Bitcoin might go higher and higher and higher never get to 8 000 in which case that order is never going to be filled you&#x27;re never going to buy that amount of Bitcoin so this order will be will be executed if it&#x27;s there if it&#x27;s not doesn&#x27;t get there the price of Bitcoin then this order will just stay open whenever you want you can just go here and you can cancel the order big thing comes up cancel order boom pending close and it&#x27;s closed so that&#x27;s how orders kind of work now why do people use them all right so when you&#x27;re when you&#x27;re trading you have two basic big schools of analysis so there&#x27;s fundamental analysis where you&#x27;re looking at the sort of the the fundamentals of a company is Apple going to do better is it going to make money have they got a new CEO how&#x27;s the stock price have they got a lot of debt um what&#x27;s lots of things earnings reports these are the fundamentals have they got new products do I think they&#x27;re going to do well in future or badly these are going to affect the price fundamentally all right I&#x27;ve heard good investors I&#x27;ve listened to have said that 80 of your reasoning should be fundamental really about the fundamentals of a company if you want to really invest properly the other part is called technical analysis now technical analysis is where you&#x27;re looking at the charts so if we go to any anything we go back to Bitcoin we go here and we can go to the charts and we can see a bit about what it&#x27;s been doing over time it&#x27;s unbelievable what it&#x27;s been doing over time now when you decide you want to buy something you want to sell something people say you should do that using fundamental analysis but then look if you look at Bitcoin it goes up and down and up and down and up and there&#x27;s all this sort of variation okay now the study of that variation and how the chart actually moves is called technical analysis so you&#x27;re studying this which is not about the fundamentals of a company it&#x27;s about how the price is moving on the actual exchanges so one thing they do is people want to find what&#x27;s called change Lenby to just reconcile these three things they&#x27;re called reversal and their dynamic Joshua valuesуй but it&#x27;s very 얼굴-ish because yeah like while Bitcoin is business actually more its main focus is to fight back whatever happen around the blockchain world and possibly designated neutral or whatever so you&#x27;re spending much more of the money you&#x27;re spending til counter interaction it&#x27;s very much you see a really important amount of money because yeah One thing they do is people want to find what&#x27;s called the best, you know, entry points and exit points. So once they&#x27;ve worked out that they actually want to make the trade, they want to invest in a company, they start looking at, all right, I want to make this buy, but what&#x27;s the best time to enter? They know that it goes up and down and up and down.</p>
        <h2 id="going-deeper">Going Deeper</h2>
        <p>So do I want to enter here and it&#x27;s about to go down? Or do I want to wait till it&#x27;s here and go up? The study of how to find the best entry and exit points, as well as looking at longer term movements is called technical analysis. So you have to study that.</p>
        <p>Technical analysis, you can study charts, you can study the sort of the trading instruments. There&#x27;s lots of different studies and stochastics and volume charts. You can put loads of things over here, different things to help you with your technical analysis. And you have to study them separately.</p>
        <p>It takes time. But once you understand technical analysis, say for instance, resistance and support. I made a video, a short video about what resistance and support is. Support would be places where it&#x27;s bounced off it in the past and it looks like it will go up.</p>
        <p>If it does it enough times, it forms support. So you can be pretty sure in future when it hits that, the market&#x27;s going to say, hold on, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to go below here and go up again. Resistance is the one above. It will stop it going up.</p>
        <p>Support below, resistance above. Once you know things like that, even basic things like that, you could set an order for where you see the support. Do you see what I mean? So I think when it gets to there, I think it&#x27;s going to go up because there&#x27;s a support level.</p>
        <h2 id="more-details">More Details</h2>
        <p>I&#x27;ll set an order at that price. Or if there&#x27;s a resistance line, you say, okay, I think it&#x27;s going to hit that resistance and it&#x27;s going to go back down. So maybe I&#x27;ll set an order if it breaks out. If it goes just above that resistance, then I think it&#x27;s going to go to the moon.</p>
        <p>So I&#x27;m going to set an order there. These are some of the things people can use orders for. Okay. So you can use it in conjunction with technical analysis to find the best possible entry points and exit points out of a trade, which you already believe in.</p>
        <p>In simple terms, that&#x27;s the difference between a trade and an order on eToro.</p>
