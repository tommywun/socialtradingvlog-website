        <h2 id="what-is-leverage-trading">What Is Leverage Trading?</h2>
        <p>Hey everyone, so, Leverage. We&#x27;ve all heard about Leverage, and a lot of people are asking, you know, what&#x27;s it do, and why be scared of it? A lot of people warn against it. So, here&#x27;s the eToro home screen.</p>
        <p>Look how nice and glossy it is, blue, big picture of a mobile, everything seems simple and lovely. Then down at the bottom here, there&#x27;s this quite important little statement. Now this, eToro wouldn&#x27;t have put this little statement here if they didn&#x27;t have to, by European law. So, there&#x27;s ESMA.</p>
        <p>They introduced regulations in Europe recently, making sure that all the trading platforms, and exchanges, and brokerages, sort of make themselves transparent. They have to warn the public about certain things. That&#x27;s what this is. It says, CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. 65% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.</p>
        <p>So, what&#x27;s a CFD? Every time on eToro, every time we make a trade using leverage, it turns that trade into a CFD, which is something you can trade. We&#x27;ll get to what that is later on, but you should consider whether you understand how CFDs work, and whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money. That&#x27;s a very stark warning.</p>
        <p>That&#x27;s not a small thing for them to have to put there, you know, it&#x27;s quite serious. So, a lot of people ask, you know, what&#x27;s leverage, and why is it so risky? So, is leverage, sort of, you know, bad? Is it evil?</p>
        <h2 id="how-leverage-works-on-etoro">How Leverage Works on eToro</h2>
        <p>Is it magic? No, no it isn&#x27;t. All it is, is it&#x27;s a way of amplifying your trade sizes. So, if you have $100, and you use times 5 leverage, it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re trading with $500, you know.</p>
        <p>The problem with that, what&#x27;s the problem? It&#x27;s because when we&#x27;re new, we don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re doing, alright. So, there&#x27;s two main things which affect traders, really, and how they trade. The big, sort of, stimulators tend to be greed, I want to make lots of money, we all have it, and fear, I don&#x27;t want to lose my money, alright.</p>
        <p>Now, fear, when mixed with a lot of leverage, can lead to blind panic, rather than just fear. Alright, so let&#x27;s go, let&#x27;s try Amazon, for instance. I&#x27;m on my trade markets page, so here, look, we&#x27;ve just signed up. We see Apple, I mean, I&#x27;ve heard of that, but I don&#x27;t know what, you know, what it&#x27;s about, if I&#x27;m new.</p>
        <p>Litecoin, we see, look, cryptos and things. There&#x27;s Google, there&#x27;s Facebook, I&#x27;ve heard of them, this is lovely. Everything looks colourful, everything looks clean and friendly, and it can be a bit deceptive. So, let&#x27;s go to Amazon.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;ve typed in Amazon, and I go to it here. So, when we&#x27;re new, if I go to, this is the price of one Amazon stock, $1,758. I can go to the trade screen here, a little button, a big button that says trade, and I can place my trade. Now, I haven&#x27;t got this much money as it shows here, I&#x27;m in my <a href="../../video/etoro-virtual-practice-account/">virtual account</a>, which you can go to here, just trade between virtual and real, just because I&#x27;m going to make some dummy trades, and show you what leverage will do.</p>
        <h2 id="the-danger-losses-are-multiplied-too">The Danger: Losses Are Multiplied Too</h2>
        <p>And I wanted to, sort of, be able to make that, and not have to worry about losing lots of money. Here&#x27;s Amazon, I go to the trade screen, and here&#x27;s where we can simply buy stuff. It all looks very, very simple. And here, there&#x27;s some buttons.</p>
        <p>So, here&#x27;s the place where I can see the amount that it costs. Amazon is currently $1,762 for one share of Amazon, alright. Let&#x27;s say I go to another one, let&#x27;s say I go to Netflix. They all show that number in the top left, so Netflix is $294 for one share.</p>
        <p>Facebook is currently $142.14. You see the number changing? It&#x27;s because the markets are live. These are live numbers, you know.</p>
        <p>So, everything has its own number, its own price for one share. So, in the trade screen, that&#x27;s what that is. That&#x27;s the current price for one share. This, the amount, is the amount of money I&#x27;m about to place a trade with.</p>
        <p>I want to place a trade for $500. <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">Stop loss</a> is an automatic thing, where if I lose this much, get me out of the trade. You can set it before the trade, or you can change it whilst you&#x27;re trading. <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">Take profit</a> is the other way around.</p>
        <h2 id="leverage-fees-and-overnight-costs">Leverage Fees and Overnight Costs</h2>
        <p>I want to make, I&#x27;m going to make this amount of profit, automatically cut it off when I make this much money. By default, it&#x27;s setting that as 50% of my size, and this one also is 50% of the amount of money I&#x27;m putting in. Here&#x27;s the leverage button, alright. Leverage.</p>
        <p>Times one. Times one means I&#x27;m not using any leverage at all. Times one, it just means I&#x27;m not using leverage. Times two, I&#x27;m using two times leverage.</p>
        <p>So, watch the units change. 0.28 units, times two, 0.57 units. I&#x27;m buying double the amount. Times five, 1.42 units, okay. So, it&#x27;s times one, times five, it&#x27;s five times that. 1.42 units.</p>
        <p>Here, if I click times ten, it won&#x27;t let me do it. It&#x27;s because Europe put in regulations recently, again those ESMA rules, you can search it, ESMA trading rules or something, and they limited the amount of leverage that new people could use, to try and stop this problem of new people using too much leverage, panicking, and just wiping out their accounts. The majority of new traders, apparently using leverage, blow their accounts, just lose all their money. Terrible thing.</p>
        <p>So, here, if I want to use enable high leverage trading, I have to click continue. I have to answer a bunch of questions, which prove that I know how to trade, or have some financial training, and then I can use the high leverage, if I satisfy those requirements. I don&#x27;t, so I&#x27;m going to go back. So, I can use times one, times two, times five.</p>
        <h2 id="tom-s-verdict-for-beginners">Tom&#x27;s Verdict for Beginners</h2>
        <p>If I was trading forex, like sterling against the currency pairs, I can use different amounts of leverage. Indices, different amounts of leverage. It depends on the asset, they&#x27;ll have different amounts of leverage available to each, okay, and it usually depends how volatile something is. So, the more something moves up and down, now different things are different volatile.</p>
        <p>They move up and down, and during the day, or the week, or the month, they&#x27;re different, you know. So, stocks are very volatile, they move up and down a lot naturally. So, they will only let you amplify that by smaller amounts, you see, because that&#x27;s what leverage does. If you&#x27;re winning, you will win much faster.</p>
        <p>If you&#x27;re losing, you will lose much faster. The velocity of how fast you win or lose, gets higher, the higher leverage you use, and this is the problem for new traders, alright. So, let&#x27;s say I go back to Amazon, and I&#x27;m going to go here. This shows you the statistics for Amazon, this is Amazon&#x27;s trading page.</p>
        <p>This shows you their chart, alright. Now, on the chart, it shows you... I can click this, and I&#x27;ve set it to one day. So, each of these little, what they call candles, these little bars, shows one day of activity.</p>
        <p>Where it&#x27;s red, it means it went down in value. It started at the top of the candle, and went down in value over the day. Where it&#x27;s green, it started at the bottom of the candle, and it went up in value over the day. Okay, so, do you, as a newcomer, know how to read these charts?</p>
        <p>I know I did. I had no idea, alright. You can change this. One day, you can have one minute charts, or you can have 15 minute charts, or you can have one week charts.</p>
        <p>I didn&#x27;t know how to read these charts when I came in, and most new people don&#x27;t, alright. So, what happens? The problem is that I would use... See how this line goes up?</p>
        <p>It doesn&#x27;t go up completely straight, does it? It sort of goes up, then down, then up a bit, then down, down, down, and then up, then down, then up, then down, up, then... It&#x27;s generally going up, but it doesn&#x27;t get there in a straight line. Now, an experienced trader, who&#x27;s studied what they call technical analysis, which is looking at these charts, and understanding the way things move.</p>
        <p>Because there are patterns in how things move, and why people buy and sell at certain times. If you study technical analysis, you&#x27;ll know. If you haven&#x27;t, you&#x27;re going to look at these charts, and it&#x27;s like, it&#x27;s like tossing a coin. I don&#x27;t know, you&#x27;d be right 50% of the time, so why not, you know?</p>
        <p>Why not, is because the really experienced people aren&#x27;t just flipping a coin, okay. They understand, generally, how things move, you see, and they&#x27;ll be able to sort of predict. So, if they buy Amazon here, and it starts dropping, they won&#x27;t just, oh my god, sell it and panic. It causes a great deal of panic, to be seeing your money dropping very quickly, very suddenly, and that panic can make you close the trade.</p>
        <p>When you shouldn&#x27;t, you should hold it open, maybe, this is not investment advice, but maybe, hypothetically, you should hold it open, and then the price will go back up, and you&#x27;ll make lots of money. But, okay, I opened, earlier on, three trades in Amazon, okay. The time is now, roughly, it&#x27;s just after four o&#x27;clock, okay. So, I opened these three Amazon trades, to sort of show this effect, alright.</p>
        <p>So, at 3.30, I opened that one for 500. Same time, exactly 3.30, I opened that one for 500. 3.30, same time, opened that one for 500. This one here, the top one, has no leverage on it. Times 1 leverage, this one here.</p>
        <p>The second one, I&#x27;ve put times 2 leverage on that one, this one here. This one here, I&#x27;ve put times 5 leverage on it, okay. This one is 5, times 5 leverage. You can see it in the units.</p>
        <p>Times 1 got me 0.28 units, times 2 got me 0.56 units, and times 5 got me 1.41 units, alright. This is just, I opened these, maybe, just over, a bit over half an hour ago. The first one has lost 3.96, the times 2 leverage has lost 7.90, the times 5 leverage has lost 18.96, see it changing, 19.33, alright. So, this really, this is like, just over half an hour ago, and you can see the difference in how much they&#x27;re losing.</p>
        <p>Now, obviously, there are certain fees associated with trading, which I&#x27;ll go into in the next video, but most of this is because Amazon has gone down in value since I opened it, and you can see that all of these are $500. I&#x27;ve spent the same amount on each one, but because I use leverage, this one, times 2, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m trading with $1,000. This one, times 5, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m trading with $2,500. 5 times 5, $2,500. So, there we are, it&#x27;s dropped more.</p>
        <p>Now, this effect, when you&#x27;re a new trader, when I was new, because I did this a lot with gold when I started, which is highly volatile. When you see yourself losing money too quickly, the temptation is to panic, because you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going to happen next. You don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s going to go up or down, you don&#x27;t know what charts mean, you don&#x27;t know how to read that stuff. So, you can close the trade when you really should hold it open, for like another two hours, and two hours time, it might go up.</p>
        <p>But, by panicking and closing it, you start to lock in losses, and you lock in more. Then, I was trying to trade bigger, to get that back, and you start chasing your losses. Greed, and fear, and greed, and fear, and it&#x27;s very easy to wipe out your account. So, that is why they caution against leverage.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s not because there&#x27;s anything wrong with leverage, it&#x27;s because the combination of leverage, and not knowing what&#x27;s happening, is dangerous. Leverage, and knowing what&#x27;s happening, fine. But, in the beginning, to use it, before you know what&#x27;s happening, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s dangerous. Because of your emotions, because of your reactions to when the market turns against you, really.</p>
        <p>So, there&#x27;s those three. What I&#x27;m going to do, is I&#x27;m going to try and break this up, because, you know, there&#x27;ll be a lot to digest. So, in the next video, what I&#x27;m going to talk about is the fees. So, we have the <a href="../../video/etoro-spread-fees-explained/">spread fees</a>, which are charged on all trades, but over here, you can see that Amazon, there&#x27;s x1, just says Amazon.</p>
        <p>The x2, and the x5, both say CFD next. Why is that? So, what&#x27;s a CFD, and what are the other fees associated with using leverage? There&#x27;s the general emotional risk, and panic, and fear that comes with using leverage, but what are the fees that are also associated with it, alright?</p>
        <p>So, I&#x27;ll discuss those in the next video. See you.</p>

      <h3 class="faq-q">What is leverage trading on eToro?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">Leverage trading means eToro lends you extra money to open a position larger than your own funds would allow. For example, with x5 leverage and $100 of your own money, you can control a $500 position. If the price moves 10% in your favour, you gain 50% on your original $100 — but a 10% move against you also loses 50%.</p>

      <h3 class="faq-q">Is leverage trading safe for beginners on eToro?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">No — leverage is one of the main reasons most retail traders lose money on eToro. It amplifies losses as much as gains, and leveraged positions incur overnight fees that accumulate over time. Most experienced traders recommend beginners avoid leverage until they fully understand the risks.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">How do I turn off leverage on eToro?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">When opening a trade, set the leverage multiplier to x1. This means you&#x27;re only using your own money and the position will be held as a real asset (for stocks). You can also change leverage on existing positions in some cases via the portfolio edit screen.</p>
