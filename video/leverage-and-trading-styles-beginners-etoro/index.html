        <h2 id="in-this-video">In This Video</h2>
        <p>Hey everybody, so if you haven&#x27;t seen the last two videos about using leverage on eToro and trading in general, check out the videos here. I&#x27;ll give you some context for what I&#x27;m about to talk about. Okay, so I&#x27;ve gone over what is leverage, how do we apply it on eToro, how do we actually click, you know, times one, times two, times five, times whatever, and some of the risks associated with that for new traders. To highlight some of those risks, here&#x27;s my portfolio, alright, so these are the Amazon trades.</p>
        <p>I had opened these three Amazon trades in my <a href="../../video/etoro-virtual-practice-account/">virtual account</a> so I don&#x27;t kind of lose my own money. And look at the number here, minus 241. So this was opened... today is the 5th of December, these were opened on the 3rd of December, so the markets haven&#x27;t opened yet today, so this is from yesterday. And we can see that the one with no leverage, I&#x27;ve currently lost $30, the ones with two times leverage, I&#x27;ve currently lost $60, the one with five times leverage...</p>
        <p>I&#x27;ve currently lost $151, alright, in two days, based off a $500 trade. So, why has that happened? If we look at the chart, the Amazon chart here, bad news basically, do you know what I mean? This is the sort of thing that can happen.</p>
        <p>So if the market turns, as Amazon did yesterday, so on my charts here, each one of these candles represents one day. So if we look at yesterday, vwoom, yesterday it dropped kind of dramatically. This is the kind of thing that can happen with leverage. So it was going up, it&#x27;s been going up nicely, boom, it suddenly drops.</p>
        <p>And what that&#x27;s led to is, you know, minus 151 on that one. So out of $500, I&#x27;ve already lost 151 of those dollars. Now obviously that could be profit as well, you know, leverage makes your stuff go up quicker, it&#x27;s kind of awesome in that way, it&#x27;s why a lot of new traders use it. We haven&#x27;t got a lot of money when we&#x27;re new, normally, and we want to make those kind of big returns quickly, we want to see something which, you know, actually means something. $3 profit, everyone goes, well, what&#x27;s the point in that?</p>
        <h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2>
        <p>There&#x27;s a lot of point in it, you know, in learning how to trade. But what we do, what I did, and what a lot of other people do, is we use a lot of leverage because we want to see results, we want to see something, you know, that actually makes sense, like I can make a living off this, or it can be a source of income. So we use the leverage, or we just don&#x27;t have enough money and we use our little money and have to use leverage to make the minimum trade size. For whatever reason we can use it, and if this happens, if the market turns against you, which it might, easily, you know, then this happens.</p>
        <p>And that&#x27;s a very depressing picture to kind of, you know, wake up to. You sort of see it and think, oh no! And, you know, what do you do now? Do you close it because it&#x27;s lost enough?</p>
        <p>Do you look at the charts and wait because it&#x27;s going to turn around? Or... This is the thing, until you know how to read charts, until... A lot of things that...</p>
        <p>Leverage can be a very difficult and frightening place to find yourself in, making losses and not knowing what to do next. So today, I&#x27;ve talked about some of the risks. It&#x27;s easy to kind of see some of them here. I wanted to talk about...</p>
        <p>Yesterday we talked about fees. The fees video I&#x27;ll link to up here. This one&#x27;s about the trading stats. How do different trading styles affect when people use leverage?</p>
        <h2 id="what-tom-found">What Tom Found</h2>
        <p>Because not everyone trades the same way. Some people... Like, I think when I came in, when I started trading, the style that I used is called day trading. I didn&#x27;t know it was called day trading!</p>
        <p>I basically wanted to make profits... It was, like, a... It was also a very poor standard of trading. And then when I came in, I was, that day, quickly.</p>
        <p>I don&#x27;t want to wait, I want to make some profit today, you know, I want to see when it goes up, buy it low, sell it high, yay, and I&#x27;m out. A hard way to trade, actually, but I think a lot of people try that in the beginning, certainly. It&#x27;s called day trading. So, I want to take you over to a page here.</p>
        <p>There&#x27;s a site called Investopedia. Now, Investopedia is a free site, as far as I know. I mean, you can read it for free, and it&#x27;s got lots of information. It&#x27;s a really good resource for people who are starting to trade.</p>
        <p>I just want to go into their page here. So, it&#x27;s Investopedia.com, University, how to start trading, how to start trading styles. And it sort of will show a little bit about some of these different trading styles and why why people use leverage. And some styles rely more on leverage.</p>
        <h2 id="going-deeper">Going Deeper</h2>
        <p>The shorter timeframes rely more on leverage than the longer timeframes. As we saw in the fees yesterday, when you use leverage, you incur <a href="../../video/etoro-rollover-overnight-fees/">overnight fees</a> and weekend fees. So, there&#x27;s little charges that can rack up over time. So, a lot of people who use longer term trading strategies, weeks or months, they are actually going to have a deal where they use leverage and they&#x27;re going to months or even years, try not to use leverage because a stock may be going up like this, but more often than not, there&#x27;s periods where it&#x27;s just going sideways.</p>
        <p>Now, if it&#x27;s going up like this constantly and you&#x27;re using leverage, great, because leverage means you&#x27;ve got more units, you&#x27;re making more money, and it outweighs those fees, those overnight and weekend fees that you&#x27;ll be paying. But very often when a stock doesn&#x27;t just go up, it can go sideways and down a bit and up a bit, down a bit and up a bit for a depressingly long time. And if you&#x27;re using a lot of leverage, it just racks up those <a href="../../video/etoro-rollover-overnight-fees/">overnight fees</a> and weekend fees consistently, and it&#x27;s an extra burden. So very often people who are trading with longer timeframes don&#x27;t use any leverage, use larger amounts of money on the actual trade, don&#x27;t use leverage, and therefore they can leave it open longer with this sort of ease of mind of not racking up fees.</p>
        <p>Anyhow, go to this. How to start trading. Trading styles. Trading timeframes.</p>
        <p>Here we go. Hold on a minute. Here we are. There&#x27;s some trading.</p>
        <p>Here we are. Here we are. Here we are. Here we are.</p>
        <h2 id="more-details">More Details</h2>
        <p>Here we are. Here we are. So, position trading is generally seen as long-term timeframe. It could be months to years.</p>
        <p>You&#x27;re holding on to these assets, you know, long time. You&#x27;re just putting in the money thinking, I believe this company&#x27;s good. They generally, people who do that trading, they look at the charts, technical analysis. We can break analysis down into technical analysis, fundamental analysis.</p>
        <p>Technical analysis, looking at the charts, looking at buying patterns, selling patterns, price movements, and getting used to sort of the mass psychology via charts. And fundamental analysis, you&#x27;re looking at the actual company. You know, the state of it. What products have they got coming out?</p>
        <p>How is their company organized? How are their markets going? Is their value chain, their distribution, how is that? How is it all the fundamentals of the actual company?</p>
        <p>Is it strong? How&#x27;s the board? Have they got a new CEO? You know, things like this.</p>
        <h2 id="further-thoughts">Further Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Fundamental analysis. So, people who use position trading long-term usually use both. They&#x27;ll know about the charts. They&#x27;ll know when to get into a trade and when to get out of trade.</p>
        <p>But they&#x27;re also heavily relying on how to get out of a trade. So, they&#x27;re also heavily relying on how to get out of a trade. How strong is this actual company actually, you know, going to be in the next year or two years? Do I think it&#x27;s going to grow?</p>
        <p>I&#x27;m going to put some money on this and just leave it for a long time. So, swing trading is shorter term. It can be days to weeks, you see. So, they&#x27;re using basically more charts, okay?</p>
        <p>They&#x27;re more looking at the charts and they&#x27;re trying to make... In trading, there&#x27;s generally... There&#x27;s cycles, you know? So, you&#x27;ll have a daily cycle.</p>
        <p>You&#x27;ll have like over the week, it may go up and down, but it&#x27;s going... Up. Over three weeks or a month. Again, it&#x27;s a cycle within a cycle.</p>
        <h2 id="the-full-picture">The Full Picture</h2>
        <p>It may be up and down, but you think it&#x27;s going up or down over those three or four weeks. And then there&#x27;s the long-term trend. If I look at the chart of anything, let&#x27;s go to Amazon and I&#x27;ll look at the chart of Amazon. Sorry, I&#x27;m jumping about a bit, but if I look at the Amazon charts, all right?</p>
        <p>So, these are daily candles. Each one of these bars represents one day&#x27;s worth of trading. So, we can see that over the day, it&#x27;s gone down. For five days, it&#x27;s gone down.</p>
        <p>Many days, it&#x27;s gone down. A few days, it goes up. But over the week, it&#x27;s gone up, but it keeps this sort of inside each day, there&#x27;s down movement, but generally, it&#x27;s going up. And then it&#x27;s going down and down and down, and then it goes up there, then big down, big up.</p>
        <p>But the general movement is down. But within that movement, you&#x27;ve got down and you&#x27;ve got up. So, if you&#x27;re trading, if you&#x27;re short selling at this date, you&#x27;d have made money. If you&#x27;re buying at this date, you&#x27;d have made money, okay?</p>
        <p>But if you had short sold it there and just held it till there, you will have also made money. Some people try and make money off the small fluctuations. Some people off the weekly movement. Some people off the monthly movement.</p>
        <h2 id="tom-s-conclusion">Tom&#x27;s Conclusion</h2>
        <p>And if we go out and out and out, so each one of these now represents a week, some people are trying to make money off a yearly trend. You see, over the year, it&#x27;s gone up, but there&#x27;s little ups and downs in amongst that. And that&#x27;s what the different styles are trying to take advantage of, timeframes. Swing trading is days to weeks.</p>
        <p>Day trading is very... is short-term. So, these people, day only, they don&#x27;t have overnight positions, okay? And because they don&#x27;t hold the stock overnight, they&#x27;ll open the trade today and they&#x27;re going to close it later today. They&#x27;re not going to close it tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Leverage won&#x27;t affect them in terms of <a href="../../video/etoro-rollover-overnight-fees/">overnight fees</a> because these two, days to weeks and months to years, they&#x27;re going to hold that stock open overnight. That trade is going to be open overnight. They&#x27;re not going to buy it today and sell it today. They might buy... open the trade today, and they might close that trade in weeks or a year.</p>
        <p>They&#x27;re going to have to pay the <a href="../../video/etoro-rollover-overnight-fees/">overnight fees</a> if they use leverage or if they&#x27;re short-selling. These people here, day trading, they don&#x27;t hold it overnight, so they&#x27;re not going to have those specific fees. They&#x27;ll still have to pay <a href="../../video/etoro-spread-fees-explained/">spread fees</a>, everyone does, but if they&#x27;re using leverage, they&#x27;re not going to incur any overnight or weekend fees. Then, you&#x27;ve got scalp trading, which is very short-term, which is seconds to minutes.</p>
        <p>They also don&#x27;t hold it overnight, so they won&#x27;t be charged any <a href="../../video/etoro-rollover-overnight-fees/">overnight fees</a>. Now, scalp trading on eToro, on the market, you can&#x27;t use it, it&#x27;s like a machine. You have to have to use it daily. This is how we do it, the way we do it.</p>
        <p>So, when we progress to the next episode, we&#x27;re going to look at the I remember when I first started, a guy called Mario Draghi was giving a speech to the European thing about, I think, Italian monetary policy or something, or European monetary policy, and I wrote on eToro, have you got... anyone got any good scalping suggestions regarding the Draghi speech? Because I thought maybe some people had some ideas about what he was going to say, and they had some ideas for a good trade which I could just do very quickly and make quick money. And someone from eToro actually commented and said, you know, we don&#x27;t allow scalping on eToro, we don&#x27;t allow that sort of market manipulation or something like that, they said. Basically, no scalping, Tom.</p>
        <p>And I thought... and at the time, you know, I wanted to say, you know, the banks, all they do is, everyone&#x27;s scalping, high-frequency trading using algorithms. They trade over, you know, microseconds, you know, thousands of trades per second, and these people are Goldman Sachs. What do you mean I can&#x27;t do it? But I didn&#x27;t get into that argument because I was very new and I didn&#x27;t want to make a lot of enemies on eToro very quickly.</p>
        <p>So, I thought, you know, I&#x27;m going to do this. I&#x27;m going to do this. I&#x27;m going to do this. But scalp trading, I&#x27;ve had trouble trying to do that on eToro, you know.</p>
        <p>Plus, for scalp trading, you kind of need very low <a href="../../video/etoro-spread-fees-explained/">spread fees</a>. Every time you open a trade, if you... when you open the trade, you have to pay the spread fee. Now, if you&#x27;re open... your trade is open for two minutes, the first thing that&#x27;s going to happen is the spread fee&#x27;s applied, so you have to make up that spread fee and then the rest is your profit. It gets difficult.</p>
        <p>You need very low <a href="../../video/etoro-spread-fees-explained/">spread fees</a>. Spread fees for scalp trading. Anyhow, I digress. So, position trading.</p>
        <p>Position trading encompasses the longest trading time frame. Trades generally span a period of months to years. Position traders may use a combination of technical and fundamental analysis. And you see, these are both links, so it&#x27;s a really useful site.</p>
        <p>You can find out what they are here. To make trading decisions, often refer to weekly and monthly price charts when evaluating the markets. So, weekly and monthly are these. That&#x27;s a weekly price chart.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s the most that goes up to here. This style of trading most closely resembles investing. Investing would be you put your money in and you&#x27;re waiting a long time based on the strength of a company. So, that&#x27;s position trading.</p>
        <p>These guys, long time, probably not using too much leverage because there&#x27;s going to be overnight and weekend fees, okay? So, swing trade. Hold on a minute. However, while buy and hold investing typically involves long trades only profiting from rising market, position traders may utilise both long and short trading.</p>
        <p>So, the difference between them and the buy and hold investor. They can use short-term ones. Swing trading. Swing trading refers to a style of trading in which positions are held for a period of days or weeks in an attempt to capture short-term market moves.</p>
        <p>In general, swing traders rely on technical analysis and price action to determine profitable trade entry and exit points. So, what&#x27;s the best place? I want to buy it, but what&#x27;s the best place to buy it? What&#x27;s the best place to close that trade as well?</p>
        <p>Paying less attention to the fundamentals, right? So, those position traders who are going in for a year, you know, they&#x27;re not going to look at it very much. They&#x27;re not going to be on their computer all day watching the charts. They want to buy it, go and get on with their life, and a year later, have faith that it will have risen.</p>
        <p>So, there we are. They have to look at the fundamentals. These guys, swing traders, more into charts, not so much the fundamentals. Trades are exited when a previously established profit target is reached.</p>
        <p>So, I want to make 20% on this trade. What&#x27;s the best place to buy it? What&#x27;s the best place to buy it? What&#x27;s the best place to buy it?</p>
        <p>What&#x27;s the best place to buy it? What&#x27;s the best place to buy it? What&#x27;s the best place to buy it? What&#x27;s the best place to buy it?</p>
        <p>What&#x27;s the best place to buy it? When the trade is stopped out, now, stopped out means they&#x27;ve set a <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>. Stop loss is an automatic feature you can set, which means if this trade ever loses a certain amount of money, just close it automatically. Same thing.</p>
        <p>So, I can not be on my computer all day watching and it can just automatically do it. So, to be stopped out means your <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>, which you&#x27;ve previously set, has been triggered and that trade is closed. So, when the trade is stopped out, moves a certain amount in the wrong direction after a set amount of time is elapsed. Because swing trading takes place over a period of days to a week, over a period of days to weeks, with an average of one to four days, this trading style does not necessarily require constant monitoring.</p>
        <p>So, they&#x27;re not looking at their computer all the time, you know. Alright, so, these guys, swing trading, they might use leverage, depending on how long the timeframe is, but less likely to use leverage because they&#x27;re going to incur fees. Especially if it&#x27;s weeks, they&#x27;re probably going to incur fees. Days, maybe they can deal with it, I&#x27;m not sure.</p>
        <p>But, still less likely. So, the swing traders are going to have to use leverage. Although they do, lots of people who are swing traders do use leverage. It&#x27;s up to you, and it depends how much you think the stock&#x27;s going to just go up or how much it&#x27;s going sideways.</p>
        <p>Just going up, probably worthwhile to use leverage because the multiplier effect on having more units is going to outweigh the cost of those fees. If it&#x27;s probably going to go sideways, then you&#x27;re just paying those fees, you know what I mean. Day trading, here we go. Day trading refers to a style of trading in which positions are entered and exited on the same day.</p>
        <p>Are we going to have <a href="../../video/etoro-rollover-overnight-fees/">overnight fees</a>? No. Unlike position and swing traders, a day trader does not hold any positions overnight. And all trades are closed by the end of the trading session using a profit target.</p>
        <p>So, I want to make 2% or I want to make 20 bucks or whatever, usually a percentage. <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">Stop loss</a>, so sorry, end of the session using a profit target, a stop loss or time exit, such as an end of day exit. So, they&#x27;ll specifically close it before the day&#x27;s closed. Day traders typically use technical analysis, those charts, to find an exploitable target.</p>
        <p>So, they&#x27;ll exploit intraday price fluctuations. Intraday, so price movements within a single day of trading. Viewing intraday price charts with a minute, tick and or volume-based charting intervals. So, they&#x27;ll use those short timeframes on the bars.</p>
        <p>Because trades are held for a period of minutes to hours, large price moves are uncommon, you see. So, unlikely it&#x27;s going to move that much in a day. So, day traders rely on frequent small gains to build profits. To leverage their buying power, day traders usually trade with margin.</p>
        <p>They usually trade with margin. They usually trade with margin. They usually trade with margin. They usually trade with margin.</p>
        <p>Now, that&#x27;s what they mean. Margin, we&#x27;re talking about using leverage to amplify the effect. Whenever you see margin, that&#x27;s the amount you have in your account which you can use to leverage, right? Many people open a margin account on other platforms.</p>
        <p>In eToro, it&#x27;s sort of built in. Day trading is a full-time job since positions have to be constantly monitored and traders need to be immediately aware of any interrupts from interruptions to the technology chain. For example, a lost internet connection or trading platform issue. It&#x27;s a bit of a nightmare because, you know, if your computer goes down and you&#x27;re day trading and the price is plummeting, ah, close it, close it, close it, you know, it&#x27;s a bit of a nightmare.</p>
        <p>Or you&#x27;re making enough money and you can&#x27;t, you know, take it. So, that&#x27;s day trading. Day traders will often use more leverage because they don&#x27;t have overnight and weekend fees. Yay!</p>
        <p>And because the price movements are going to generally be smaller in a day, they need to amplify the effect, you know? So, scalp trading, extremely active form of day trading. It involves frequent buying and selling throughout the trading sessions. Scalp traders target the smallest intraday, in the day price movements, rely on frequent and very small gains to build profits.</p>
        <p>So, these guys are going to use a lot of leverage, more likely they&#x27;re going to use leverage. But it&#x27;s considered very risky because it relies on having a high percentage of winning trades, because they&#x27;re making hundreds, if not more, you know? There we go. So, and because the average winning trade is generally many times smaller than the average losing trade, it can take just a little bit longer.</p>
        <p>So, it&#x27;s a bit of a nightmare. So, if you&#x27;re going to be trading at a high percentage of winning trades, you&#x27;re going to need to be very careful. So, one or two losing trades to wipe out all of your profits. Precision is paramount with this style of trading and scalping requires constant attention to the markets.</p>
        <p>So, scalping, we can&#x27;t really do it on eToro, but they&#x27;re easy to use as well. Then there&#x27;s high frequency trading, where they&#x27;re using algorithms to just suck money out of the financial markets like Hoover. Unbelievable, but you know, it&#x27;s the big banks and physicists and really advanced mathematicians write code which automatically trades. There&#x27;s some great documentaries on YouTube.</p>
        <p>I think the Wall Street Code by Backlight. Watch that one. There&#x27;s a few of them. Amazing.</p>
        <p>Quantitative analysts. Quantitative analysts or quantitative quants, they call it. Anyhow, so different styles of trading use it. So, the shorter the timeframe, the more likely it is that you&#x27;re going to be using leverage and because they&#x27;re paying attention to the effect of the overnight and weekend fees.</p>
        <p>Although, people using longer timeframes do use leverage often, you know. Maybe they&#x27;ll use less leverage and not the maximum amount to try and stay safe. So, over on eToro here, we have on their page, eToro.com, Trading Academy Leverage Margin. Can you lose more money than you put in when you&#x27;re using leverage?</p>
        <p>What about that? Can you sort of use leverage and just wipe out your account and wipe out all your money because these moves can be so big? So, down on this page, which is... I&#x27;m going to go back to the first one.</p>
        <p>Okay. So, this is, you know, a bit about leverage. What can I do to minimize risk when trading with leverage? While trading with leverage can lead to increased profits on successful trades, it also carries the risk of magnified losses.</p>
        <p>There are, however, risk management tools at your disposal on eToro to help reduce potential loss. So, what are these? Things you can do to try and make yourself a bit safer. First one it mentions is <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>, which is that predefined number you can set.</p>
        <p>All right. Apply a <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> to close a trade in the event that the market moves a specified amount against your target. So, you can set your stop loss according to a specific level in the market, rate, or as a monetary amount, $20 or $100, also shown as a percentage of your initial investment in the window. You <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a>.</p>
        <p>Again, it&#x27;s an automatic one. When I&#x27;ve made this amount of money close the trade. <a href="../../video/etoro-negative-balance-protection-most-you-can-lose/">Negative balance protection</a>. Although not required by law, in the rare occasion in which market conditions cause your account&#x27;s balance to go negative , eToro will absorb the loss and balance your account.</p>
        <p>So, if your account balance ever goes negative, they&#x27;re not going to say, right, you&#x27;ve wiped out your account. You owe us $5,000 or $20 or whatever. Give us that money. Apparently, they&#x27;re not going to do that.</p>
        <p>They&#x27;re going to absorb the loss. And here it talks about the fees, which is in the last video for leverage. So, that&#x27;s talking about your overall account, but does it apply to individual trades? And can the <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> ever fail?</p>
        <p>Yes, there are conditions where the <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> fails. So, the stop loss can go... It doesn&#x27;t quite work like that. So, I&#x27;m going to go back to eToro.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;m going to go to the Help section, and I&#x27;m going to type in here, <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> stocks. Okay, I&#x27;m just going to type that. So, what is a stop loss? We&#x27;ve seen what stop loss is.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s said it&#x27;s a monetary amount or a percentage of your initial investment trade window. Same stuff. In normal market conditions, when the market reaches your requested rate, and you have lost the previous trade, you can stop the loss. So, you can stop the loss, but if you only loss a predetermined amount, the <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> order will trigger and automatically close your position in normal market conditions.</p>
        <p>However, the set stop losses are not guaranteed. Okay? They&#x27;re not guaranteed. During volatile...</p>
        <p>Volatile meaning it&#x27;s spiking up and down. There are big price movements for whatever reason. It could be there&#x27;s bad news has come out about the company, or big or good news, or the overall market is... Something serious is happening.</p>
        <p>During volatile periods when it spikes... Spikes? Boom! It&#x27;s going to fall suddenly goes up or suddenly goes down.</p>
        <p>Market gaps and slippage. What&#x27;s a market gap or slippage? Let me just show you a market gap on Amazon. So, you know how we trade?</p>
        <p>When we trade Amazon, we can only trade it when the New York Stock Exchange, wherever it&#x27;s listed, the market, the exchange it&#x27;s listed on is open, alright? So, that&#x27;s only like, you know, a few hours a day, the rest of the time it&#x27;s closed, nothing&#x27;s happening. But, the markets are open for this amount of time. On either end of that time, there&#x27;s before Pre-Trading Session which is closed.</p>
        <p>We can&#x27;t trade on that eToro, but there are other people in the world who can. It&#x27;s like an hour or two hours or an hour and a half, I&#x27;m not sure. But there&#x27;s a time frame, just before the market opens Pre-Trading Session and just after the market closes which we can trade on, just after the After Hours Session where the price can move. Now, big things have happened.</p>
        <p>There&#x27;s big news about Amazon or Jeff Bush just about great... Jeff Bush&#x27;s TikTok Surčanda this year. Jeff Bush&#x27;s TikTok Surčanda this year. Jeff Bush&#x27;s TikTok Surčanda this year.</p>
        <p>Jeff Bush&#x27;s TikTok Surčanda this year. Bezos has revealed he&#x27;s an alien, or something, whoa, has happened. It&#x27;s not going to be that, but you know. Something, big price moves can happen.</p>
        <p>A lot of people pre-market session can suddenly start dumping the stock, which means when the day&#x27;s trading opens, our normal day&#x27;s trading, the price will suddenly be much lower than it was when the market closed yesterday. So, the market closed here, pre-trading begins, and everyone starts dumping the stock. The normal market opens, and the price is suddenly down here, much lower. It was here at the end of business yesterday, and suddenly it&#x27;s here, and suddenly we&#x27;ve lost a lot of money, and the price opens with a huge loss.</p>
        <p>Same thing can happen. So, the day goes on, it keeps trading, and then we&#x27;re used to this price. This is where the price closes. There&#x27;s the after-hours session, and some great news comes in.</p>
        <p>Jeff Bezos is not an alien. It&#x27;s all just a rumour. Boom, everyone starts buying it. So, now this isn&#x27;t showing up, we still see the end-of-day price, but the price has started going up after hours.</p>
        <p>So, the next day, when it opens, there&#x27;s the pre-trading, it goes up a bit more. When the market opens, suddenly the price has gone from here to here, all right? So, it gaps. It&#x27;s called gapping up.</p>
        <p>When it goes up, it&#x27;s gapped up. When it goes down, it&#x27;s gapped down, all right? So, I&#x27;ll show you an example of this in the chart, because it gapped up the other day. So, if I put it on a daily chart, you see, look at these three charts.</p>
        <p>So, if I put it on a daily chart, you see, look at these three charts. So, if I put it on a daily chart, you see, look at these changes. So, it went from here, this day. This is where the market closed the day before.</p>
        <p>The market closed here, all right? So, it&#x27;s going up as the markets opened. Next day, each one of these represents a day at the moment, each bar. So, it closed, it opened here.</p>
        <p>The next day, it opened here, and that&#x27;s where it closed. Then, something happened after hours, or in the pre-market trading the next day, where suddenly the next day, the price went and just opened at a very different higher level. Okay? That&#x27;s called gapping up, okay?</p>
        <p>So, some people may have set a <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a> here, and the take profit hasn&#x27;t been reached, but their take profit might have been here. So, overnight, by the time the markets open the next day, the take profit couldn&#x27;t have been triggered at this point, so the market automatically, the system, triggers that take profit at the next, closest available price. So, the second it opened, people would set their take profit here. The take profit would have been triggered, that have made more money actually than they wanted to with the take profit, but it was triggered, their trade is closed and the money&#x27;s returned to the balance.</p>
        <p>Now, that is a gap up. There can be a gap down. So, let&#x27;s say after the markets closed on this day, there was bad news about Amazon and everyone started trading and the price was dropping. We wouldn&#x27;t see that price change live on eToro, okay?</p>
        <p>We wouldn&#x27;t see it. Then the next day, there&#x27;s pre-market trading and the price is still dropping. And so, that next day, let&#x27;s say we&#x27;ve set our stop-loss at this level, okay? But the stop-loss can only trigger when the markets are actually open and our account is connected to those markets.</p>
        <p>So, we&#x27;ve set a stop-loss here, the day&#x27;s trading&#x27;s ended, people in after-hours trading start trading, it&#x27;s gone past our stop-loss. Does our stop-loss trigger? No, because our eToro is not connected to the live markets at those points. The live markets are not showing that price moving yet.</p>
        <p>The next day comes and there&#x27;s the pre-market trading and it&#x27;s still dropping. It&#x27;s now way past our stop-loss, but it&#x27;s still dropping and our stop-loss hasn&#x27;t triggered. So, the next day when the markets open and eToro connects those markets, our system sees that the price is way down here, very much lower than our stop-loss which was here, and so it automatically goes, alright, the stop-loss was here, but I will trigger it here because the <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> is already triggered. So, that&#x27;s a very bad news.</p>
        <p>So, we&#x27;ve set a stop-loss here, but I will trigger it here, because the stop-loss is already past, and I will trigger the stop-loss at the next available price. So, here are stop-loss triggers. So, we&#x27;ve now closed the trade at this price, and we&#x27;ve lost far more than we wanted to with our stop-loss. That can happen.</p>
        <p>Now, for the price to move from here to here, something terrible has to have happened, right? For the gap to be that big, something really bad, it&#x27;s very unusual. Even something terrible has happened to the company, or the market as a whole, something terrible has happened. In normal trading, that won&#x27;t happen, but it can, all right?</p>
        <p>And if you&#x27;re using a lot of leverage when that happens, you can incur quite serious losses. So, when it&#x27;s very volatile, using leverage, that can also happen, all right? And it can trigger your stop-loss, and oh my god, I&#x27;m out of the trade. It automatically closed my trade, and I&#x27;ve lost a lot of money.</p>
        <p>The alternative, the other way it can happen, it might gap up, and all of a sudden, yay, I was using lots of leverage, I&#x27;ve made lots of money, but the risk is kind of high with that one. That&#x27;s something to be aware of. Now, normally, when we set a trade, let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m back at Amazon, I&#x27;m still on Amazon, and I want to start a new trade on Amazon. When I start a new trade, sorry, hold on.</p>
        <p>When I start a new trade on Amazon, I&#x27;m still in my dummy account. I set the amount here. As a default, I can only set the stop-loss to 50%, minus 50%. I can&#x27;t change it.</p>
        <p>I want to add more. I can&#x27;t do it. Stop-loss can&#x27;t be lower than 50%, all right? They&#x27;ve done that to try and protect people.</p>
        <p>So, they don&#x27;t want you setting your stop-loss at 90% and just losing all that money. So, at 50%, the automatic stop-loss is going to hit, you know? Now, I already have in my portfolio some Amazon positions open. I can actually go into them, I can increase that stop-loss when the trade is open above that.</p>
        <p>I can increase it above 250. But look, an additional 100 will be debited from your available-to-trade funds. So, I can extend it, but it&#x27;s going to take that money from my available funds. Now, I can do that with my account.</p>
        <p>Check if you can do it with yours, because I started using eToro a long time ago. I&#x27;m not sure if different rules apply. But look, it will take that from my available funds, and it means from here, the available funds, I won&#x27;t be able to use those funds in another thing. So, there is a way where you can lose a lot of money when the market gaps up or gaps down if you&#x27;re using leverage.</p>
        <p>That&#x27;s also a dangerous thing. So, trading styles, there we go. The shorter the time frame, the more likely you are to be using leverage. So, people trading shorter time frames more often use leverage, because they don&#x27;t want to incur the overnight and weekend fees.</p>
        <p>Longer styles, if you&#x27;re trading for a long time on a specific asset, and you use leverage, you&#x27;re going to incur a lot of money. So, if you&#x27;re trading for a long time, you&#x27;re going to accrue more fees over time. If it&#x27;s going up all the time, great. But more than likely, there&#x27;ll be times where it&#x27;s going sideways, or down terribly, losing money, but sideways even, you&#x27;re racking up those fees without making extra profits.</p>
        <p>So, if the market gaps up, it gaps down overnight, you can lose significantly more than you wanted to, significantly more than the <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> you set on that trade. So, be aware of that as well. That&#x27;s it. I&#x27;m going to leave it there.</p>
        <p>That&#x27;s a long video. Thank you.</p>
