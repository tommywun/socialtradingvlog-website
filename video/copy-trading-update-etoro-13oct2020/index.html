        <h2 id="in-this-video">In This Video</h2>
        <p>Hey everybody, hope you&#x27;re doing really well. I hope you&#x27;ve been enjoying the Trader Reviews. I&#x27;m kind of tempted to copy Prototype VR, but I&#x27;d have to add more money. I&#x27;ve only got 200 extra available dollars in there, and I don&#x27;t want to take any money away from any of these people, so I&#x27;d have to add some money to copy Prototype VR.</p>
        <p>There isn&#x27;t a lot of history on them still, I think, you know, there is risk and all the rest of it, but I&#x27;m tempted for some reason. The other one&#x27;s obviously doing well as well. If you copy them, a lot of comments from people who are already copying people, and sort of seem to be doing well mostly, so that&#x27;s great, but might copy Prototype VR for whatever reason. Apparently he watched my review on Twitch on a live stream.</p>
        <p>I hope it wasn&#x27;t too bad, you know, I haven&#x27;t watched it, I don&#x27;t dare watch what he said about my review of him, but there we go. To the portfolio. They&#x27;re all in green, look at them, all in green, everyone&#x27;s in green. BalticSeal has been in red since I started copying him, so it&#x27;s really nice to see that he&#x27;s broken through into green.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s just lovely to see this colour as opposed to the red colour. At the moment, how am I doing? At the moment, for the month, I&#x27;m back in green, I&#x27;m at 1.59. I actually think it should be higher than that.</p>
        <p>I actually think there&#x27;s something wrong, and there was a day left out, but there we are, I&#x27;m at 2.74. It&#x27;s slightly in profit, better than the banks. Better than the banks for the year, and I enjoy it, so that&#x27;s good. A lot of this, a lot of <a href="../../copy-trading.html">copy trading</a> is because I still just find it really interesting and fascinating.</p>
        <h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2>
        <p>As you can see, you know, people comment about it, are you making lots of money and all the rest of it? No. I mean, the first year, obviously, I lost in the second month a ton, that&#x27;s kind of really unfair because I was gambling, basically. But overall, I&#x27;m about breaking even, but I actually do really enjoy it, you know.</p>
        <p>If I haven&#x27;t sort of lost money, and I haven&#x27;t made money... My mum said, you know, it&#x27;s a bit like bingo. People go and they play bingo for the fun of playing bingo. I know it&#x27;s not, and this is investing, and this is serious, and I don&#x27;t mean to equate it to bingo, but what I&#x27;m saying is, I still kind of enjoy it.</p>
        <p>So, if I&#x27;m beating the banks, I&#x27;m kind of happy with that. I know people want to make a lot more, I want to make a lot more, but whatever. I shouldn&#x27;t have said that, I shouldn&#x27;t have talked about bingo, that&#x27;s not right. Anyhow, Olivia Danville.</p>
        <p>Olivia Danville is kind of always really the same. Every time I talk about him in a video, it&#x27;s up a tiny bit, or, you know, usually up a tiny bit, because he&#x27;s always green, but it&#x27;s always a very tiny amount. So, we&#x27;ll go into that, and just have a look how Olivia Danville&#x27;s done so far for this month. He&#x27;s on 0.29% for September. 0.29%, he&#x27;s up 2.63% for the year.</p>
        <p>Really, it&#x27;s roughly the same as me. What am I at? I&#x27;m at 2.74%! I&#x27;m beating Olivia!</p>
        <h2 id="what-tom-found">What Tom Found</h2>
        <p>Anyhow, whatever. So, Olivia Danville, he&#x27;s at 2 points... What was it again? He&#x27;s at 2.0.29% for September, he&#x27;s at 2.63% for the year.</p>
        <p>Still all in green. Something I wanted to comment about, actually, is that this percentage here, because I saw him commented on... Someone had commented something, I didn&#x27;t even translate it, but he had mentioned me in the comments, and it was about how this isn&#x27;t a fair representation of the money I&#x27;ve made, because I&#x27;ve added and lost money. One of the easiest ways to see this, is with two other people.</p>
        <p>So, Baltic Seal and Lombard Earnings. Look how I&#x27;m copying them both with $600. They&#x27;ve both made roughly the same money, but one has made 0.44%, and one&#x27;s made 0.24%. How is that possible?</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s because when I started copying Lombard Earnings, I was actually copying it with around $1,000, and it works this percentage out, off the original amount I invested in them. And it doesn&#x27;t... Now, I add money, I&#x27;ve taken money away... With Lombard Earnings, all I&#x27;ve done is, once I took $400 away, so I put it down to $600, and it&#x27;s still calculating off the original $1,000.</p>
        <p>So, even though they&#x27;ve made me roughly the same money, I&#x27;ve got roughly the same invested, this one is almost double that one. Because, actually, that should be 0.24% off $1,000. It&#x27;s a problem, it&#x27;s a flaw with the system. So, you can add and remove money from people you&#x27;re copying, whenever you want, but it&#x27;ll mess these up.</p>
        <h2 id="going-deeper">Going Deeper</h2>
        <p>It won&#x27;t... This will be right. The actual amount of money they&#x27;ve made me, or lost me, will be accurate. That&#x27;s the actual money, you know.</p>
        <p>And so will the fees here, this will stay accurate. But, and this is overnight, and <a href="../../video/etoro-rollover-overnight-fees/">rollover fees</a>, any dividends, I think, are included in there. But the percentage that they&#x27;ve made me, messes up, and it&#x27;s annoying. I wish eToro could work it out, but it&#x27;s probably insanely complicated maths, or something.</p>
        <p>I don&#x27;t know why else they wouldn&#x27;t do it. I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;s really difficult maths. So, when we&#x27;re looking at Olivia Danville, I&#x27;ve added money, taken money away, added more money, taken money away. I&#x27;ve done so many changes to my copy of Olivia Danville, that this number just doesn&#x27;t make any sense anymore.</p>
        <p>It doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not 2.7... $74.63 is not 2.77% of $1,000. It&#x27;s just under 10%, really. 10% of $1,000 would be $100. It&#x27;s just under 10%.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s about 7.4% ... realistically, of $1,000. So, that&#x27;s ... don&#x27;t pay much attention to that. So, there&#x27;s Olivia Danville. He&#x27;s still in green, still making me money.</p>
        <h2 id="more-details">More Details</h2>
        <p>Minus $1.71 in fees. He&#x27;s the one with the biggest fees, but I&#x27;ve been copying him for ages. People ask, how long have I been copying Olivia? Here, start copy on the 25th of January, 2019.</p>
        <p>So, it&#x27;s just under two years I&#x27;ve been copying him. There&#x27;s Olivia Danville, slow and steady. I&#x27;m going to go into slow and steady over here. Go to his stats, how much has he made for the month? 0.78% so far in October. 0.78% is just under 1%.</p>
        <p>He lost $1.71 last month, and $0.78 up so far this month. He&#x27;s on $6.56 for the year. If I go back, I just want to... where&#x27;s my copy? Hold on, I&#x27;ll go back to my copy of slow and steady.</p>
        <p>I started copying him on the 8th of the 5th, January, February, March, April, May... 8th of May. $27.79 profit so far. If I go down to the bottom here, total open, this shows the amount of the money that I&#x27;m... I get asked this a lot, you know, why aren&#x27;t they investing all of the money I&#x27;ve copied them with? Some traders do, some traders don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s just their style.</p>
        <p>I look at the percentage they&#x27;ve made me. Their style, how much of my money they actually use in trading, how much they hold back for security or risk management reasons, or whatever reasons, kind of not my concern. I just look at how much have they made for me, how much are they costing me a lot of fees, and how much money, what percentage have they made for me. So, out of the money I&#x27;ve invested with him, he&#x27;s invested $1,031.16.</p>
        <h2 id="further-thoughts">Further Thoughts</h2>
        <p>All of the money I have invested in him, because if we go back, if I go back just quickly, I&#x27;m actually... net invested is $1,000, net invested is after I&#x27;ve added money, and taken money, what&#x27;s the true amount that I&#x27;ve actually invested in him. Then there&#x27;s the profit here, profit and loss. Then there&#x27;s fees, there&#x27;s a little bit in fees that he&#x27;s made me. In all, it&#x27;s $1,030.77.</p>
        <p>So that&#x27;s the value, is the true amount I&#x27;m now copying him with. When he places a trade next, it takes into account that I&#x27;m copying him with $1,030. That updates daily, I believe. Sometimes you see it updating here at night.</p>
        <p>So $1,030.77, and he&#x27;s actually invested slightly more somehow, whatever, but that&#x27;s it. All the money I&#x27;m copying him with, he has actually, currently invested. In the open trades, he&#x27;s at minus $1.39 profit and loss, for the trades that he still has open. But he&#x27;s closing trades, so he&#x27;s closed enough trades to make me $29.18 in profit and loss, and there&#x27;s some refunds there.</p>
        <p>And I can go view, and this shows me all the trades which he&#x27;s actually... I&#x27;ve closed via him. You know, the copied trades which are actually closed now, that&#x27;s money in the bank, you know, which goes back into my copy of him. But over here, look, you see there&#x27;s a lot of closed trades here, some in profit.</p>
        <p>This one&#x27;s quite a big loss. Well, it&#x27;s $3.20, it&#x27;s big money, but it&#x27;s actually a small percentage that he&#x27;s lost there. And over here, you see him on, for instance here, on the 1st of the 9th, 1st of September... January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September... 1st of September, he closed a bunch of trades on the same day.</p>
        <h2 id="the-full-picture">The Full Picture</h2>
        <p>So these are all closed on the same day, and they&#x27;re all in the same company, IUSB. Look at them, all in the same, sort of, ETF, sorry. He&#x27;s closed them all, and for varying degrees of profit, $0.09, $0.13, closed them all on the same day. And that seems weird, yeah, like he&#x27;s been opening and closing them.</p>
        <p>He opened them all on the 21st, he closed them all on the 1st. So this is a way to see that when people buy into an asset, they don&#x27;t... Let&#x27;s say they&#x27;re going to buy Tesla, and they want to spend $1,000 on Tesla. They won&#x27;t usually the traders won&#x27;t just buy $1,000 on buying Tesla, and go for it.</p>
        <p>What they&#x27;ll do is they&#x27;ll sort of try and get a good average price, or they&#x27;ll try and hedge their risk. So they might buy in 10 trades of Tesla, each trade being $100. Forget the minimum trade sizes for the moment, it&#x27;s just to illustrate a point. Instead of buying $1,000 in one chunk, they might buy 3 different lots of $350, or 10 lots of $100.</p>
        <p>They buy in slowly, and it keeps making money, alright, they buy more. Keeps making money, they buy more. Sometimes as it&#x27;s losing, they buy more to cost average, so that their average buy-in price is lower. Sometimes, as it&#x27;s winning, they just add more to it to keep winning.</p>
        <p>So what we see is that we get all of these little trades. So if we go into someone&#x27;s portfolio here... Let&#x27;s go to slow and steady at the moment, and we click on TIP. He&#x27;s got $354.88 of my money invested with TIP.</p>
        <h2 id="tom-s-conclusion">Tom&#x27;s Conclusion</h2>
        <p>It looks like this is the portfolio, and it&#x27;s one trade, but when we click into it, we see all the little trades. That&#x27;s how he&#x27;s actually buying into it. Now he&#x27;s bought them all, actually on the first, and the second. Most of them on the first, and some on the second.</p>
        <p>But he&#x27;s buying in slowly, and I think it&#x27;s also so that you can close some of them, or partially close it, and get out of it slowly. Well, I think you can do that anyhow, but this is... A lot of the traders, when they get more professional, they don&#x27;t buy in in one big chunk. They buy in slowly, gradually, and they often get out of position slowly, gradually, by closing bits as well.</p>
        <p>So, there are various reasons they do that. But there we are, slow and steady, doing well at the moment. He was really down, he&#x27;s kind of back up. JNemesis, storming away.</p>
        <p>Look at that, $193.20. Now, I haven&#x27;t changed, I haven&#x27;t added more money, or taken more money off Jay. It&#x27;s been $600 since the beginning, I&#x27;ve just left it. So, this number here is accurate.</p>
        <p>He&#x27;s made me 32.20%. When did I start copying Jay? I started copying on the 24th of the 3rd of this year. January, February, March.</p>
        <p>The 24th of the 3rd. So, in under a year, so far, he&#x27;s made me 32%. Thank you Jay, that&#x27;s magnificent. It&#x27;s a huge return.</p>
        <p>Let&#x27;s see what he&#x27;s been closing. So, at the moment, how much of my money is he using? Total open is $754.96. So, that&#x27;s how much of my money he&#x27;s actually using.</p>
        <p>All of it, basically. So, he&#x27;s using all the money I originally invested, plus all the profit he&#x27;s made for me. It&#x27;s all being reinvested at the moment. So, as you make profits from someone you&#x27;re copying, those profits are just automatically reinvested back into it.</p>
        <p>The copy is like a fund. The profits just get ploughed back in, so the person can... Hopefully, they&#x27;re making profits. If they&#x27;re losses, you know, it goes down, but if they&#x27;re profits, they&#x27;re ploughed back in, so the person I&#x27;m copying can make bigger and bigger trades, and keep using that money.</p>
        <p>If he&#x27;s winning, or she&#x27;s winning, let that trader use my money. It&#x27;s kind of a lovely system. It&#x27;s automated, it&#x27;s why I like <a href="../../copy-trading.html">copy trading</a>, it&#x27;s what kind of drew me to eToro, really. So, he&#x27;s invested all of the money I&#x27;m copying with, and all of the profits he&#x27;s made for me.</p>
        <p>If I go to view of the closed trades, I can&#x27;t see him at the moment. For some reason... There we are. Hold on...</p>
        <p>View... There we are. He&#x27;s closing that one. Look at that, he&#x27;s closed the two Etsy trades there. 30% profit.</p>
        <p>So, that he opened on the 24th of September, he&#x27;s closed on the 12th of October. That&#x27;s massive profit in a short time frame. 30%, 32%, 17%. The money doesn&#x27;t seem huge, because it&#x27;s a small trade. He only traded with $7.53 out of the money that I copied him with, but what a huge percentage that is, to have made.</p>
        <p>This one he&#x27;s closed at $0. A lot of green here, a lot of green. Some smaller ones, and some bigger ones again. Losses are small here.</p>
        <p>Closing a lot of trades, really, it&#x27;s mostly green by far. This is showing... That&#x27;s amazing, actually. This is really good. 10.23, so he&#x27;s been doing very well for me.</p>
        <p>He&#x27;s got a lot of trades open. Let&#x27;s have a look... Hold on... Back...</p>
        <p>If I go back to JNemesis, the value of the trades that are open is... The open trades are $25 in profit. The closed trades... He&#x27;s been closing loads of it, so this is money that&#x27;s cashed out.</p>
        <p>He&#x27;s closed the trades, the money&#x27;s in the bank. $167.47. So, there&#x27;s been people I&#x27;m copying in the past, where all of it is in open trades. They just leave them all open, and the money goes up, and then it goes down. It&#x27;s all open.</p>
        <p>I like it when, obviously, they&#x27;re closing trades, and kind of banking that money, and they get to use it. It&#x27;s safer, you know. They get to use it in the future trades. It&#x27;s not just all on open trades.</p>
        <p>Hold on, it&#x27;s starting to rain, so I have to be careful of my equipment. I&#x27;ll be back in a second. The next one is Miyoshi. Miyoshi is up at $19.61.</p>
        <p>Another one... When I copied Miyoshi, obviously, it drew down, and now it&#x27;s nice to see him in profit with his stats. How&#x27;s he doing? Miyoshi is on...</p>
        <p>He&#x27;s on 1.21%. Now, look how low that looks. It&#x27;s a tiny little green bar, and obviously, it&#x27;s in proportion to this... $27.49. So, visually, that was such a big month, that all the other ones will look low, even though he&#x27;s made $1.21 so far in October.</p>
        <p>Made a profit... He&#x27;s made a profit every month, actually. So, 62.54% so far for the year. It&#x27;s a massive gain.</p>
        <p>Obviously, this one here, this month here, $27.49, obviously really inflated that, but he&#x27;s done really well the other months. If you&#x27;re looking at it, he&#x27;s in profit. He&#x27;s profitable throughout the year. 62.54%... He&#x27;s doing really well.</p>
        <p>Let&#x27;s have a look at his chart... How&#x27;s his chart doing? Really good, really smooth. He&#x27;s still on that sort of smooth, slow uptick over here.</p>
        <p>That&#x27;s a 20 moving average, I&#x27;ll get rid of that. Really good. Well done, Mr Miyoshi. So, if I go here, close it...</p>
        <p>So, he&#x27;s got $198.14 of the money I&#x27;ve invested in him, which is $600, but now it&#x27;s $619.55, because remember, that&#x27;s ploughed back in. The value is the true amount I&#x27;m copying in with now. Out of that money, $600, he&#x27;s only got $198.14 currently invested. So, you see how some traders will use all your money, some won&#x27;t use all your money, some will use very small amounts of your money.</p>
        <p>So, what I go by is how much they&#x27;ve actually made me in the end. So, out of that, he&#x27;s got $4.25 in the open trades, they&#x27;re in profit. The ones which are still open are currently in profit. These ones here, these are the currently open trades I have with him, and overall, they&#x27;re in profit.</p>
        <p>And closed trades, $15.30. If I go and have a look at some of those closed trades, really small loss, really small loss, much bigger profit. He&#x27;s letting the profitable ones run, he seems to be cutting off the losers still. That one&#x27;s from the 23rd of September to the 12th of October, so it&#x27;s not that long a time frame.</p>
        <p>He&#x27;s made really good profit there, and mostly it&#x27;s green. He&#x27;s closing stuff in green, mostly. Really good, he&#x27;s doing well. Yeah, that&#x27;s great actually.</p>
        <p>So, this is accurate with him as well. So, 19.61 I haven&#x27;t added money or taken money away from Miyoshi, so this number here is still accurate. 3.27% he&#x27;s made me. When did I start copying Miyoshi? On the 23rd of September.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s not even a month ago that I started copying him. He&#x27;s already made me more than banks used to make me in a year. Now, does that mean everyone copy him and do it? This is not investment advice.</p>
        <p>Obviously, he could have lost that much money very, very easily. He hasn&#x27;t, which makes me happy. Yay, it&#x27;s gone well, but I&#x27;m not sure about any of this. It&#x27;s super risky.</p>
        <p>I keep saying it, trading is super risky. Some people ask that. Someone was talking about they were going to buy a house, but they were thinking, I won&#x27;t buy a house, I&#x27;ll just put the money in eToro, what do you think? And obviously, that&#x27;s ... it&#x27;s so risky.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s so risky. It&#x27;s really, really risky. Most people lose money. Keep remembering that.</p>
        <p>Keep remembering that. I would spread my risk. If I had $100,000, what would I do? Would I even put it all in here?</p>
        <p>I&#x27;d check for the investor&#x27;s compensation scheme. There&#x27;s an amount of money where if eToro goes broke, we&#x27;re compensated for an amount of money. That&#x27;s not, you know... Check what it is in your region, there&#x27;s many things.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;ll make a video, a series of videos just about that, but really risky. 3.27% he&#x27;s made me. He could have easily have lost it. He hasn&#x27;t, I&#x27;m smiling. It&#x27;s nice to see everything in green, but really risky trading, in general.</p>
        <p>Not just on eToro, in general. Most retail investors lose money. That&#x27;s us people. The un-financially trained people lose money.</p>
        <p>Or, you know, be aware. So, Baltic Seal over here is in profit, which is lovely to see, because he was in red, and I hate it when I start copying someone, and then they&#x27;re just straight into the red. It often happens. Sometimes it keeps going, sometimes it turns around.</p>
        <p>Usually it turns around, because hopefully I&#x27;ve picked people who have historically good stats, and can trade... Hopefully. But, there we are. So, his open trades, he&#x27;s actually got 584 of the 600 I&#x27;ve invested in him, in open trades.</p>
        <p>He&#x27;s using it currently. 3.06%. So, out of the active trades here, that one&#x27;s doing really well, isn&#x27;t it? QQQ. Out of the active trades here, he&#x27;s $3.06 in profit.</p>
        <p>Total closed, he&#x27;s actually at a loss, so he&#x27;s relying on his open trades to make that profit. So, he hasn&#x27;t been banking those profits yet. And the closed ones, it&#x27;s a bit of a mixed bag. There&#x27;s about as many losing as there are winning.</p>
        <p>So, it&#x27;s a bit strange there with Baltic Seal. Closed on the 6th of October. So, a bit strange there with Baltic Seal, but he is in profit at the moment. People talking about how he may have changed his trading style since he became a <a href="../../popular-investor.html">popular investor</a>.</p>
        <p>I have no idea. I&#x27;ll keep watching. His historical data is still good. If I go to his chart here, Baltic Seal, what are we looking at?</p>
        <p>So, we&#x27;re going up, and up, and up. Boom! He stopped trading during the intense volatility, then he was going up, and up, and up, and he&#x27;s been having a bit of a rough time, but he looks like he might be back on an uptick at the moment. We&#x27;ll wait and see, obviously.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s a very short amount of time. When did I start copying him? On the 10th of the 8th, January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August. 10th of August of this year. It&#x27;s now September, October.</p>
        <p>A couple of months, so no, we&#x27;ll leave that. Lombard Earnings. Lombard Earnings is at... Let&#x27;s see where they are for the month.</p>
        <p>Hold on, did I check Baltic Seal, where he is for the month? Let&#x27;s just have a look on his stats. He&#x27;s at 1.20% so far for October. So, he did draw down more than this last month, but he&#x27;s up a little bit.</p>
        <p>He&#x27;s at 35.63% for the year, which is a really... We haven&#x27;t got a lot of history for him. It&#x27;s still risky, but he&#x27;s done well. I&#x27;m happy to look at that, happy to give it a try.</p>
        <p>His risk scores are so low. His max <a href="../../video/etoro-drawdowns-copy-trading-risk/">drawdown</a> is so low, minus 2.92%. So, obviously, this is a guy who is concerned about not drawing down too much. Whether that&#x27;s by luck and fortune so far, but I don&#x27;t think so.</p>
        <p>He&#x27;s not gone for huge gains. Look, he&#x27;s gone for, sort of, consistency here, and so, I&#x27;m happy to leave Baltic Seal at the moment. I&#x27;m not really worried about him. Lombard Earnings.</p>
        <p>Lombard Earnings has had a difficult time in my portfolio. So, since I started copying Michela Marroni and team... I think there&#x27;s a team... From what I get, she&#x27;s struggled a bit.</p>
        <p>If I go to the stats, so far, 0.19% for October. She hasn&#x27;t struggled that much at all, just making small gains. That&#x27;s like her style. It&#x27;s very, very low volatility.</p>
        <p>Sorry, Michela. So, there we go. Not struggling, really, at all. Just making consistent, but lower gains. 3.93% for the year.</p>
        <p>So, obviously, more than banks would have given me 10 years ago. It depends what your goals are for your investments. Do you want to make high returns with higher risk? Lower returns with lower risk?</p>
        <p>Obviously, if you can find higher returns with lower risk, big win! And we&#x27;ve seen that, and some of the people I&#x27;ve reviewed recently, their, sort of, risk to reward ratio is really quite good. But, there we are. She&#x27;s 3.93% so far for the year.</p>
        <p>If we look at the chart, it&#x27;s going to be... It looks really jagged, doesn&#x27;t it? But these jaggednesses we&#x27;ve seen before, that goes down from 10,400 all the way down to 10,327. Do you know, so it&#x27;s a huge spike, but these spikes, and how this looks visually, is comparative to how that person trades.</p>
        <p>So, if this person suddenly lost 10%, it would be off the scale. These are tiny losses, but because she only ever makes tiny losses, it looks fairly volatile. You know, it&#x27;s one of those things. It&#x27;s a visual thing.</p>
        <p>So, there we are. At the moment, really flattened off quite a lot. We&#x27;ll see what happens with that. Still leaving Michela.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;m going to go back, and I&#x27;m just going to see how much of my money she&#x27;s using. 40.25% open investment. Now, Michela&#x27;s strategy is different. It depends on the different investments. Someone who buys, has a long, short portfolio.</p>
        <p>So, they&#x27;re generally... So, they&#x27;re buying assets, and they&#x27;re buying some, and they&#x27;re shorting others as a hedge, you know. They&#x27;re going to have portfolios like Jay&#x27;s, which are really full, and are using up, kind of, all of my money. So, Michela&#x27;s whole strategy is to invest in products around the time when they release their earnings reports.</p>
        <p>Obviously, usually quarterly. It can change, but four times a year, companies will release their earnings report, and tell the world how they&#x27;re doing. How much profit have they made in the last quarter? What are their forecasts for the next one?</p>
        <p>How have they done? And during these times, prices are very, very, very volatile. So, people speculate, oh, we think they&#x27;ve done better this year. We think, you know, they&#x27;re going to beat their forecast.</p>
        <p>You know, all these analysts put in forecasts, what the companies do, what we think we&#x27;re going to make by the next quarter. So, around the time when that company actually releases its earnings report, people are speculating. Are they going to beat their earnings? Are they going to fall short of their earnings?</p>
        <p>And there&#x27;s lots of more volatility around a company&#x27;s price, equity price, around these earnings reports. So, what Michela&#x27;s strategy is, is to invest in companies shortly before the earnings reports. Whether she thinks they&#x27;ve analysed them, and they&#x27;re going to beat their estimated earnings, or they&#x27;re going to fall short. If they beat them, price should go up.</p>
        <p>If they fall short, price should go down. So, around that time... So, all the companies don&#x27;t release their earnings reports at the same time. There&#x27;s only a few at the same...</p>
        <p>They do it at different times throughout the year. She&#x27;s tracking, I believe, a few hundred different companies. So, these will be the companies which currently have their earnings reports. Let&#x27;s pick one here...</p>
        <p>Commercial Metals Co. Let&#x27;s just look it up. So, commercial... I looked it up before.</p>
        <p>Commercial Metals Co. earnings date... If we look it up, 15th of the 10th, they do it the other way around. 15th of the 10th, so that&#x27;s 15th of October 2020, they&#x27;re going to have their earnings date. Today is the 13th of October. So, she&#x27;s sticking to her strategy.</p>
        <p>Her strategy is just before the earnings, you&#x27;re going to see these trades come out, and obviously buying, buying, buying, buying... She thinks they&#x27;re going to do well after the earnings report, you know. So, that&#x27;s why she only has 40.25% of the money we&#x27;ve invested with her open, because she doesn&#x27;t invest constantly all the money you&#x27;re copying with. She opens trades sort of prudently, judiciously, based on how well she thinks that company&#x27;s going to do, and the direction she thinks they&#x27;re going to take.</p>
        <p>She thinks these are all going to do pretty well after earnings, and she&#x27;s putting in this much of the money. How much money are we copying her with? I&#x27;m actually copying her with, at the moment, $600. So, she&#x27;s only invested 40.25% of that at the moment.</p>
        <p>So, out of the open trades, 0.004% loss so far on these trades. We&#x27;ll see how they do over the next few days, because over the next few days, earnings reports will come out. These will either be in profit, or loss, and she&#x27;ll close them. Never keeps them open longer, so it&#x27;ll be a few days before, to sort of a few days afterwards, usually, from what I see.</p>
        <p>Total close, she is banking some of those profits. If we go to view, 0.50. So look, she&#x27;s opened that on the 9th and the 10th, closed on the 12th. Opened on the 9th, closed on the 12th.</p>
        <p>Opened on the 8th, closed on the 9th. Opened on the 8th... So, these are all earnings reports. I reckon if you look up these companies here, you&#x27;re going to see that these earnings reports were some time in between the open and close date.</p>
        <p>Small... She&#x27;s taking small gains... Small gains... Losses...</p>
        <p>A couple of losses there... Small losses... But you see, keeping very low volatility. She&#x27;s not going for huge gains and huge losses, she&#x27;s just trying to be consistent.</p>
        <p>And mostly, they&#x27;re winning. Camera went off again... So, Lombard Earnings, I was just saying, 0.24% won&#x27;t be accurate, because I&#x27;ve obviously changed money. It&#x27;ll be around double that, so she&#x27;s been doing well.</p>
        <p>There we are, there&#x27;s the portfolio at the moment. So, overall, everything&#x27;s in green. Seems to be going well, it&#x27;s nice, they&#x27;re doing well, trundling along. I might copy Prototype VR, I might actually add some more money and copy him, just because, I don&#x27;t know why.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s a bit of a risk, not that much trading history. Sorry Prototype VR, if you&#x27;re watching this, I&#x27;m not meaning to say he&#x27;s risky. Again, not investment advice, everyone copy who you want, you know, I&#x27;m just sort of trial and error. Again, really, I can&#x27;t possibly know what they&#x27;re going to do in future, I can&#x27;t.</p>
        <p>But so far, these guys are in green, doing well. I&#x27;m enjoying that, that&#x27;s nice. I&#x27;d better get out of here before it starts raining badly again. So, I hope you&#x27;re all doing really well, whatever you&#x27;re doing.</p>
        <p>Thanks to all the guys on Patreon, by the way. All the people, the few people, three or four, who actually support the channel, support me on Patreon. That&#x27;s really kind of you. They recently made it so that I can add memberships on YouTube.</p>
        <p>I might switch over to that, even though I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d offer as perks for the members, no idea. But it&#x27;s really interesting. Love having a channel. Thanks all for watching.</p>
        <p>Thanks for putting your likes when you put likes. Thanks for all the people who newly subscribed. It&#x27;s great having a YouTube channel. If you don&#x27;t have one, find something you enjoy, anything, and start a YouTube channel.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s genius. And especially during these times, if there&#x27;s something you can sort of do, no matter where you are, and from home. Even if it&#x27;s not for money, although money&#x27;s awesome. But it&#x27;s just really great fun to be able to create something, and make stuff, and have people comment.</p>
        <p>So, thanks for all your comments, and almost at 40,000 subscribers, which is really great, you know. So, thanks everyone for the likes. Thanks for the subscribes. Share the videos if you can.</p>
        <p>I know, I went into a plug there, but thanks a lot. And I hope you have a great, great day, and take care. See you, bye bye. Bye bye.</p>
        <p>Bye bye. Bye bye.</p>
