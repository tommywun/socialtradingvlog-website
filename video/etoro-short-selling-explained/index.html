        <h2 id="what-is-short-selling">What Is Short Selling?</h2>
        <p>Hey everyone! So, what&#x27;s short selling? People want to know what short selling is. Basically, what it is, is it&#x27;s a way to make money off an asset, any asset, as the price is going down.</p>
        <p>Normally, when you&#x27;re trading, and when I sort of first thought about trading and stuff, I always used to hear buy low, sell high, you know, that was always the thing. You want to buy something, and I always expected that as it goes up in price, you know, it becomes more valuable. So, I buy one thing at $10, you know, in a week later it&#x27;s worth $20, so I can sell it for $20. It&#x27;s very simple kind of math.</p>
        <p>Buy low, sell high! You make money as the asset goes up in value, but you can also make money as the value of an asset falls in value, and it&#x27;s referred to as selling. Now, there&#x27;s a bit of a language problem here, a little bit of a language problem, so... because when you get used to trading, when you start trading, some of the language that I used out in the... well, in the past, I&#x27;ve used some language that I used out in the the normal world beforehand, you know, I&#x27;d say, yeah, I want to sell Apple. And I used to think that meant I have some Apple stock and I want to get rid of it and change that for money and go away and do something with my money.</p>
        <p>But when it comes to trading, there&#x27;s two different terms. So, if you open a sell position in Apple, it means you&#x27;re opening a trade which is betting that the value will go down. And as the value of Apple goes down, you want to make money off it as the value goes down. You&#x27;re betting against the price of Apple stock.</p>
        <p>That&#x27;s when you open a sell position. So, if I&#x27;m going to sell Apple, kind of, it takes a bit of discipline from everyone because it&#x27;s context-based. You&#x27;ve got to watch it. People mix up these terms.</p>
        <h2 id="how-to-short-sell-on-etoro">How to Short Sell on eToro</h2>
        <p>But a sell position is generally making profit as it goes down. If someone says, oh, I&#x27;m going to sell my Apple, because they&#x27;ve got the word, my, in there, they&#x27;re probably meaning they want to close their position in Apple. That&#x27;s the correct kind of technical term, you know. You have a position, you could open a buy position or you could open a sell position.</p>
        <p>It means you&#x27;ve opened a trade. You can change the word position for a trade, alright. So, you can have a buy position or a sell position. That&#x27;s your positions open.</p>
        <p>Whenever you&#x27;ve either made enough money from any of those positions and you want to take the cash, you close that position. Or, if you&#x27;re losing too much money and you don&#x27;t want to lose anymore, you can also close that position. Alright? So, that&#x27;s closing a position or closing a trade, alright.</p>
        <p>It means you want to get out of it. You&#x27;ve got something open, you want to get out of it and you want to take your money and run, basically. Do something else with it. A sell position, a sell position, not closing a position, but a sell position or a sell trade is different.</p>
        <p>That&#x27;s the one way you want to make money as the value of something goes down, okay. It&#x27;s not that confusing. I&#x27;ll show you. Why it&#x27;s not that confusing.</p>
        <h2 id="the-risks-of-going-short">The Risks of Going Short</h2>
        <p>Here I am in trade markets, alright. Really simple. Let&#x27;s say I go to... say I go to gold and here&#x27;s the familiar button, just when I want to open any trade on any asset. Here I go to trade and at the top, we&#x27;ve got buy and we&#x27;ve got sell.</p>
        <p>Buy, sell, buy. They really couldn&#x27;t have made it much simpler for us, alright. And what these mean, if you press buy, it means you want to bet that the value of the asset is going to go up, alright. This is the current price, alright.</p>
        <p>This is the price that you can buy it at, actually. It&#x27;s not really the current price. It&#x27;s the current price plus their little bit of a <a href="../../video/etoro-spread-fees-explained/">spread fee</a>. That&#x27;s what that price actually is.</p>
        <p>And you can tell that it&#x27;s not the actual price because look. If I press buy, here&#x27;s sell. Watch this price as I click sell. You see it changing.</p>
        <p>Alright. So, somewhere in the middle of those two prices, the buy price and the sell price, there is the actual price of gold at the moment. If I buy it, they already... They ain&#x27;t making any money.</p>
        <h2 id="overnight-fees-on-short-positions">Overnight Fees on Short Positions</h2>
        <p>So, you can see that the price is going up. And actually, you can see that the price has gone up. So, make me buy it slightly higher than the actual price, than the market price. That&#x27;s their <a href="../../video/etoro-spread-fees-explained/">spread fee</a>.</p>
        <p>If I sell it, I buy it at a slightly lower price than the actual market price. That&#x27;s their <a href="../../video/etoro-spread-fees-explained/">spread fee</a> again. Alright, that&#x27;s why that number changes when you press these. So if I want to buy it, it means I bet the value will go up and I want to make money as it goes up.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s a 1319, it goes up to 1320, I&#x27;ll have made some money. Awesome. Now if I want to bet that the value will go down, all I do is I press sell. And as I press sell, I buy it at 1318.60.</p>
        <p>If the value goes down to 1317, I&#x27;ll have made money. Converse is also true though. The other way is also true. So when I buy, if the value goes up, I make money.</p>
        <p>If the value goes down, I lose money. If I&#x27;m selling an asset, if the value goes down, I make money. If the value goes up, I lose money. Okay?</p>
        <h2 id="should-beginners-short-sell-on-etoro">Should Beginners Short Sell on eToro?</h2>
        <p>Now, what does that mean? If you think about it, why is it more risky potentially when you&#x27;re selling something? Alright, so if I buy it, it can go up infinitely from here. It won&#x27;t.</p>
        <p>Do you know what I mean? Well, not yet unless everything collapses or whatever, but it won&#x27;t go up, but it could go up to 3000. Yeah? The most it can go down is 1319.02.</p>
        <p>Then it&#x27;s at zero. Okay? So my risk on the downside, that&#x27;s how much risk I have, which is a lot because usually, you know, you use leverage with gold. But if I&#x27;m selling, okay, it can go down to zero, in which case, that&#x27;s the amount of profit I could make because remember, I&#x27;m hoping the value will go down.</p>
        <p>Profit. What&#x27;s the potential downside? It&#x27;s infinite. So if it goes up to 3000, you know, that&#x27;s all loss for me.</p>
        <p>It won&#x27;t. And if you&#x27;re buying you profit, but don&#x27;t you think that something&#x27;s going to come right now? But what I&#x27;m trying to highlight is a point. When you&#x27;re buying, you set your <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a> above and you set your <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> is a lower number.</p>
        <p>When you&#x27;re selling, your <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a> is a lower number and you&#x27;re <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> is a higher number. Okay? That makes sense. Because if it goes up in value in your selling, you&#x27;re losing money.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s fairly simple. I&#x27;m sure you understand it. Alright, so how does that work? How, in God&#x27;s name, name does that work where you can make money selling something?</p>
        <p>Alright, so when you buy, you buy it. If it goes up in value, someone goes, oh, I&#x27;ll buy it now, I think it&#x27;s going to keep going up in value, and you go, alright, you have it now, give me the money, give me the value for it. Yay, I&#x27;ve made my money. Selling is a little bit sneakier, really, in how it actually operates.</p>
        <p>Alright, so, a way to imagine it is, let&#x27;s imagine that I&#x27;ve been looking at Apple stock, alright, I&#x27;m looking at Apple stock, and I&#x27;m standing next to my friend John here, and John&#x27;s also looking at Apple stock, and there&#x27;s a big crowd of people over here who are also looking at Apple and talking about Apple. Now, John and these other people, they all think, wow, Apple&#x27;s doing really well, man, I think that new iPhone&#x27;s great, I think, look at this, what they&#x27;re releasing, I think the value is going to go up, it&#x27;s looking rosy for Apple, but I, sneaky guy, have heard some news. I&#x27;ve heard some news about the latest iPhone, I haven&#x27;t really, this isn&#x27;t investment devices, it&#x27;s just an example. Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;ve heard some new, some advice, and this advice isn&#x27;t so good, this information isn&#x27;t so good, I think the price of Apple is actually going to go down, you know.</p>
        <p>These guys, this whole crowd here, John and these other people, they&#x27;re all clamoring, they all want Apple. I have some secret information that it&#x27;s going to go down, somehow, or gut feeling. So, I go over to the broker and say, hey broker, could you just give me a hundred shares in Apple? It&#x27;s ten dollars.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;m going to give you a hundred shares in Apple. It&#x27;s ten dollars. It&#x27;s ten dollars a share, alright? So, give me a hundred shares in Apple and I&#x27;ll give them back to you, okay?</p>
        <p>And I&#x27;ll give you <a href="../../video/etoro-spread-fees-explained/">spread fees</a>. I mean, really, that&#x27;s what eToro is making. It&#x27;s always making the spread fees. Whether we&#x27;re buying or we&#x27;re selling, they make their spread fees.</p>
        <p>So, I go to the broker, hey man, lend me, lend me a hundred, a hundred shares in Apple. He goes, yeah sure, give them back to me. I go, yeah, of course, I&#x27;m going to give them back to you. He gives me a hundred shares in Apple, alright?</p>
        <p>I then go and I sell them to John. I go, hey John, he&#x27;s my friend. Actually, I feel bad about John. So, I go over to him, I go over to him, I go over to one of the people in the crowd and I say, hey John, here are you guys in the crowd.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;ve got a hundred shares of Apple and everyone&#x27;s going, oh my god, Apple&#x27;s going to go up, Apple&#x27;s going to go up. So, they buy them off me. So, I&#x27;ve just sold a hundred shares, which I borrowed off the broker. I sold them to this crowd for ten dollars each.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;ve got a thousand dollars, yeah? Now, what happens is that Apple&#x27;s price, I was right. My information was correct. So, Apple&#x27;s price starts to fall, alright?</p>
        <p>So, I&#x27;m here with my thousand dollars from those hundred shares I borrowed and sold to the crowd. The price is going down. The price is going down of Apple. It goes down to five dollars, alright?</p>
        <p>Like a couple of weeks later, it&#x27;s five dollars per share. So, I take my thousand dollars. I owe the broker, remember. I don&#x27;t owe him an amount of money.</p>
        <p>I owe him a hundred shares. That&#x27;s what I borrowed off him. So, I take my thousand dollars and I go over to the crowd who are now like, oh god, I want to get rid of these. It&#x27;s going down.</p>
        <p>I go, I&#x27;ll buy them off you. So, I go over and I buy a hundred shares for five dollars. Okay? That&#x27;s five hundred dollars, alright?</p>
        <p>I go, I spend five hundred dollars on those shares. I take the shares, the hundred shares, which I&#x27;ve bought for five hundred, and I give them back to the broker. I&#x27;ve paid the broker the <a href="../../video/etoro-spread-fees-explained/">spread fee</a> and he&#x27;s happy, alright? So, I now have, I&#x27;ve given him back his hundred dollars.</p>
        <p>I have five hundred left. I sold them for a thousand. They went down. When they went down enough, I went and bought them back and gave them back to him.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s left me with five hundred dollars. That&#x27;s how you make money with the prices going down, in a sort of simple analogy. Okay, so in that same analogy there, what happens if the price goes against me? So, I&#x27;ve just borrowed the hundred shares off the broker.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;ve sold them to these guys for ten dollars a share. I&#x27;ve got a thousand, alright? Now, I have to give the broker back his hundred shares. The broker is always going to get paid, alright?</p>
        <p>They&#x27;re not like the nice guy just doing me a favour here. Broker&#x27;s going to get his money, alright, every time. So, I owe him a hundred shares. So, let&#x27;s say the price actually goes up instead of going down.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;ve sold them. Ten dollars each. I&#x27;ve got a thousand dollars, alright? So, I&#x27;m waiting two weeks and now the price hasn&#x27;t gone down to fifty.</p>
        <p>It was a hundred. I was expecting it to go down. It&#x27;s gone up to a hundred and fifty. I&#x27;ve still got to give this broker guy his hundred shares back.</p>
        <p>So, I&#x27;ve got to buy them back now. So, I have to go to that crowd, cap in hand. I have to spend that thousand dollars I made and I also have to fork out another five hundred dollars of my own money. Because it&#x27;s now they&#x27;re a hundred and fifty each and I need to buy a hundred, you know?</p>
        <p>So, I have to actually pay out an extra five hundred dollars. So, that&#x27;s how you&#x27;d lose money in that situation. Either way, I have to give this guy his hundred shares back. And I can&#x27;t, you know, just make the money out of it or change the market or something.</p>
        <p>Literally, if the price goes the wrong way, I&#x27;d have to buy those shares back and I have to give those hundred and fifty... those hundred shares back to him. That&#x27;s what happens in that analogy if it goes against him. Either way, he&#x27;s getting paid. Broker&#x27;s always getting paid.</p>
        <p>Now, why doesn&#x27;t the broker charge me interest or something to borrow those shares? On other places, I think they actually do. On eToro, it seems to be it&#x27;s just the <a href="../../video/etoro-spread-fees-explained/">spread fee</a>. They just want their spread fees.</p>
        <p>If I open a buy trade, I pay them <a href="../../video/etoro-spread-fees-explained/">spread fees</a>. If I open a sell trade and do my sneaky business, then I also owe them spread fees. I always pay spread fees. Now, do I have to go through this complex process of buying from him, selling to them, getting it back, taking it...</p>
        <p>No! I just press sell. No! I just press sell.</p>
        <p>If the value goes down, I&#x27;m making money. If the value goes up, I&#x27;m losing money. You know, if I lose too much, they&#x27;ll stop me out of the trade. It&#x27;s that simple.</p>
        <p>But I just wanted to explain the mechanics of how can that happen, how can it be done. You borrow from the broker, you sell to someone at that time, you wait till the value goes down, you buy the assets back and give them back to the broker, you keep the difference. So, it&#x27;s kind of how selling works. There&#x27;s a lot of people talking about how, you know, there might be a correction, there might be a this, there might be a...</p>
        <p>A correction is a way of saying the market goes horribly wrong, by the way, the price goes down. They never say, I think the price is going to drop. They always try and coat it in a more positive way of looking at it. There&#x27;s a correction.</p>
        <p>So, even when it goes down, it&#x27;s correct somehow, you know. So, basically, if there&#x27;s a correction, the whole value goes down. This is a way that people can make money, even if the value of assets is going down. It is risky though.</p>
        <p>I mean, I listen to people, especially around cryptos, judging... If you&#x27;re going to sort of do... I tried initially when I first started, this idea of... You know, I&#x27;m not going to say it You know, I&#x27;m not going to say that it&#x27;s risky or slightly risky to sell now, but I&#x27;ll say you know, or 1. if you are doing something wrong, you&#x27;re not?</p>
        <p>Closing this, you&#x27;re not losing anything? At student investment, but to shift shopping at student investment, you are greatly more likely to lose something, which are you buying or you&#x27;re buying losing? You&#x27;re looking at whether you should accept it or not. Closing-off industrial trade some examples No.</p>
        <p>Problem with industrial trade. I never thought I&#x27;d flip a stock or into a unit market. The traditional stock están jays They mean, as much as the money you deposit has enough them. But at the moment, I&#x27;m not trying to do that.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;m not trying to buy and sell. And I hear Jay, you know, he was trying to short Ripple and he got so much flack for it. He really did. People were just going nuts.</p>
        <p>But anyhow, even he says, you know, how difficult it is to short cryptos because they move in such a volatile way. It&#x27;s very hard. You know, I found it as well, very, very hard to judge where to buy and sell. So I&#x27;m not doing that anymore.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m going with the general overall trend rather than, you know, the spikes in that trend. Do you know what I mean? Instead of going buy, sell, buy, sell, buy, sell, buy.</p>
        <p>So I&#x27;m just going to buy. Do you know what I mean? And trying to disregard this. I&#x27;m going with longer term trend.</p>
        <p>But that is how you do short selling on eToro. It&#x27;s actually fairly simple. You just click the sell button, put your trade and realize that your <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> and your <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a> will be the other way around against the... the value of the stock.
