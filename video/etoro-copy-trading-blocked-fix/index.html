        <h2 id="what-does-copy-trading-blocked-mean">What Does &#x27;Copy Trading Blocked&#x27; Mean?</h2>
        <p>Hey everybody, so I&#x27;m here, it&#x27;s night time in St. Julian&#x27;s, I&#x27;m back at Porto Masso Cafe because I&#x27;m a bit of a nomad at the moment. I&#x27;m staying at my brother&#x27;s house, renting my flat out to try and earn money to put into Kia eToro, so I can build my account size and so, a bit nomadic, it&#x27;s night time. Anyhow, something I wanted to talk about is, a few people have got in touch with me, and I get this question, sort of quite a lot, from very new people to eToro, and so I wanted to just answer it.</p>
        <p>Some people, sort of, leave me a comment saying that they&#x27;ve tried to copy someone, and the eToro says you cannot copy, you&#x27;re blocked from copying people, and they ask why could this be, and I get this quite a lot. Now, the fix is fairly simple, alright, so what I&#x27;ve done here is, because I&#x27;m on eToro already, I&#x27;ve, sort of, tried to sign up a new account here, which I can show you. Now, when you sign up a new account, obviously... hold on, I&#x27;m going to escape from that, so this is a new one. Here, Tom Fund, I&#x27;m not going to do a new account, but here, when you start a new account on eToro, you have to ask those questions.</p>
        <p>They ask you a bunch of questions to fill in your profile, you know, what sort of risk do you want, what are you happy with, they&#x27;re trying to find out how much experience you have, whether you&#x27;ve traded before, obviously your address, your name, your phone number, where you live, but they ask some questions which are about risk, and they&#x27;re trying to work out, can we let this person trade, or is this person definitely going to lose too much money, land themselves in trouble, and then it will make us as a company, eToro, not me, eToro, look bad, you know. I think that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re trying to do, and I think they&#x27;re trying to comply with European laws. So, there&#x27;s this bit here, complete profile, which we do when we sign up, and I had to start a new account, just so I could, sort of, go through it and show you. So, some of the questions in here, if you set them too strictly, it doesn&#x27;t seem to let you copy people, okay.</p>
        <p>So, we&#x27;re going through them, my trading experience, I&#x27;m going to put one to three years, let&#x27;s just put that, and I&#x27;ll go through it, just to show you the ones which seem to cause problem. What&#x27;s your level of trading and educational knowledge? Now, I&#x27;m going to go through these quickly, and I&#x27;m going to cut to the ones which seem to cause the trouble, because they&#x27;re specific questions, what risk do you want, if you set that too low, it won&#x27;t let you copy trade, and there&#x27;s another one about what do you want the money for. So, when you&#x27;re going to trade on eToro, you want to make money.</p>
        <p>What&#x27;s that money for, they ask you, and if you put that it&#x27;s, you know, it&#x27;s the money I&#x27;m going to live on, it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve got, then no, no, no, don&#x27;t let this guy copy trade. It seems to be that question, you have to change it, sort of, you know, additional income, basically, like, I don&#x27;t need the money. The more it looks like you&#x27;ve already got money, and this is just something on the side, the more they&#x27;ll say, okay, this guy can copy trade. So, I&#x27;ll go through these quickly, hold on.</p>
        <h2 id="common-causes-of-the-error">Common Causes of the Error</h2>
        <p>Trading frequency, let&#x27;s do daily, duration of open positions. You see, this is all risk stuff, they&#x27;re trying to test the risk. Duration of open positions, so the shorter that is, the more risky it will be. You see, daily will be more risky than once a week, or once a month, they&#x27;re trying to work out your risk, in all of these questions, but hold on.</p>
        <p>So, purpose of trading, what best describes your primary purpose of trading with us. This seems to be the question, if you change the answers to this, they&#x27;ll let you copy trade. Now, that&#x27;s not to say, so look, short-term returns, I just want to make money quickly. Additional revenues, like I&#x27;ve already got some revenues, but I want to make some more on the side.</p>
        <p>Future planning, say for kids, education, retirement, or saving for a home. I think, like, additional revenues is probably the safest one to put here. However, I don&#x27;t want to say to you, change all these answers, whatever, just lie. I&#x27;m not saying that at all.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s best to put the truth, and it&#x27;s best, obviously, most people who start trading, retail traders, as I&#x27;ve said in other videos, do lose money when they start. So, it is something to think about, really heavily, can I afford to lose this money? Because most people actually do. They do lots of stuff, I made a video about why here, or why I think, anyhow, here.</p>
        <p>But, most people do, so have a good think about how much risk you&#x27;re really willing to take. But, if you&#x27;re copy blocked, completely, going back into your profile, and changing the answers to these questions, can actually unblock the copy. I&#x27;ve asked people, and they&#x27;ve said that this is how they did it. So, I&#x27;ll go on to the next one.</p>
        <h2 id="how-to-fix-it-step-by-step">How to Fix It — Step by Step</h2>
        <p>Attitude to risk. How much do you plan to deposit into your eToro account over the course of a year? I&#x27;m going to put 1k to 5k. Which risk reward scenario best describes your annual investment expectations with eToro?</p>
        <p>So look, they&#x27;re trying to find out, do you want to get 80% return, and 48% risk? They&#x27;re seeing so that, if you put this one, 5% reward minus 3, that means you want really low risk. So putting it probably somewhere in the middle, might be the safest. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the most realistic, and again, best to answer honestly, because most people, you know, do take too much risk when they&#x27;re new.</p>
        <p>Financial status. What are your sources of income? So your sources of income, I&#x27;m going to put salary. Do you know, they&#x27;re trying to work out, can you afford to lose this money?</p>
        <p>Basically. I think it&#x27;s good to be honest, and it&#x27;s good to understand that there&#x27;s a tonne of risk in trading. A tonne, no matter how glossy, and no matter what people say, it&#x27;s a risky thing. Alright, so, but that&#x27;s how you do it.</p>
        <p>You can just change the answers in that bit, and it seems to unblock copying, then you can copy people. Alright, there we go. So, back now to my portfolio. Quick thing, here, do you remember I was up to the yellow star, last month?</p>
        <h2 id="when-etoro-blocks-copying-automatically">When eToro Blocks Copying Automatically</h2>
        <p>There we are, it&#x27;s downgraded, back at the blue star. So, I wanted to know if that was something that was possible, and it is. You can actually go back down a level. Why is that?</p>
        <p>So, I&#x27;m going to make a video about the Popular Investors Programme, and how you move up the stars, a whole video kind of series. But just to go over it quickly here, it&#x27;s because my assets under management have to be above $40,000. So, if you take all the people who are copying me, they have to invest at least $40,000 with me, and then it has to stay there for a certain time, and then they&#x27;ll put me up to the yellow. Now, that&#x27;s dropped, you know, I started making videos about how I&#x27;m going to trade cryptos, and there was the crypto boom, and everyone went into crypto traders, so it&#x27;s dropped.</p>
        <p>So, for now, they&#x27;ve downgraded me. I went from blue, up to yellow, I was getting $500 a month, and then because my AUM dropped and it got lower again, they&#x27;ve actually downgraded me to blue. And I did want to know if that could happen, now I know. You know, not the best, but there we are.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;m just going to wait, I believe my portfolio is going to make money, but it&#x27;ll make money slowly. So, my green stats should rack up over time, and if people want to copy me, they can, if they don&#x27;t, they don&#x27;t. But I believe it&#x27;s going to grow, but I&#x27;m going to do this really for myself. My goal, again, it&#x27;s why I&#x27;m renting out my flat, get $20,000, put more money in, low risk, more money, and we&#x27;ll see what happens there.</p>
        <p>So, another thing is about the videos that I&#x27;m going to be making. So, I wanted to make a video about everything to do with eToro&#x27;s statistics. How profits are calculated, obviously how the charts in the stats, how this is made, where&#x27;s this generated from, and some people were saying that there might be a chance to, sort of, manipulate it, and I wanted to ask eToro directly. Now I&#x27;ve asked them before about this, I&#x27;ve asked my account manager, is it possible to manipulate these stats, because I&#x27;ve seen instances where there seem to be some unusual things, and he said there are times when things can go slightly wrong with them, but eToro&#x27;s constantly watching and they&#x27;re checking for this.</p>
        <h2 id="preventing-it-from-happening-again">Preventing It From Happening Again</h2>
        <p>But I&#x27;ve asked them, I&#x27;ve got all the questions that I could, and I ask you guys to send in questions. I&#x27;ve got all the questions I can about this, about in the portfolio, why does it show different statistics in my closed trades, and in my chart, and the statistics on my current charts, which ones take into account fees, which don&#x27;t have fees. I&#x27;ve asked all of these questions, is it possible to manipulate, how are you going to stop that, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I&#x27;ve asked them all to eToro, I&#x27;m waiting back for the answers.</p>
        <p>The other one that I&#x27;ve asked about from eToro is, because I want to put more money, my new strategy involves putting much more money in, so I&#x27;m going to have low-risk traders, they&#x27;ll make less profits, but I&#x27;ll put more money in, you know. I&#x27;ve asked eToro about the insurance, because the second I think about putting $20,000 into eToro, I start thinking, well hold on a minute, that&#x27;s a lot of money for me, it&#x27;s going to take a long time for me to make it, and I want to make sure it&#x27;s safe. What if eToro goes bankrupt, what if there&#x27;s a huge financial recession, or a crash, what happens to my money, how safe is it? Now I know that there&#x27;s the eToro, there&#x27;s the European, and the UK, because I&#x27;m registered with eToro Europe, there&#x27;s also eToro UK, and they both have the Investor&#x27;s Compensation Fund.</p>
        <p>So, I want to find out as much as I can about that, how it works, what happens if everything does go bust. So, I&#x27;ve gone, and I&#x27;ve looked, and I&#x27;ve found on the eToro Regulation and Licence page, just if I go down, there is a bit here, you can download about the Investor&#x27;s Compensation Fund, it&#x27;s quite hard to find, but there we are. Here&#x27;s the one for the UK, and here&#x27;s the one for Europe, and on both of them, there&#x27;s like an email address where you can write to the actual regulators, the UK regulators, and the European regulators, to try and find out more about how that works. Now, I&#x27;ve written to them, what exactly is going to happen?</p>
        <p>Should the worst come to worst? How do we do that? How do we talk to them? How do we get in touch?</p>
        <p>How long will it take to get the money back? Will there be a bottleneck if everyone&#x27;s suddenly complaining at once, and trying to get their money back? So, I&#x27;ve read as much as I can about it, and I&#x27;ll be honest, the UK one seems much more information from the UK one, than the European one, but I&#x27;ve written to them both, and I&#x27;ve asked for more information about how that works. And when I know, I&#x27;m going to make videos and I&#x27;ll tell you about what I know.</p>
        <p>So, there we are, that&#x27;s it, that&#x27;s it for the moment. If you&#x27;re having problems with the <a href="../../copy-trading.html">copy trading</a>, you&#x27;re copy blocked, go back into your profile, look at those answers when you set it up, especially the ones about what you&#x27;re going to use the money for, and how much risk you want. Maybe change those answers, see if there&#x27;s another answer you can put which is also honest, and that should unblock it. If not, if in any doubt, I&#x27;m not eToro, get in touch with eToro directly, but I thought I&#x27;d just share that quick fix, because it&#x27;s worked for so many other people.</p>
        <p>And the other one is about the videos that I&#x27;m going to be making. I hope you guys are doing very well, and see you in the next video. See you guys.</p>
