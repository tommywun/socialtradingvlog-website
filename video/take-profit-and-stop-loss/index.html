        <h2 id="in-this-video">In This Video</h2>
        <p>Alright, so <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">Take Profit</a> and <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">Stop Loss</a> deal with two things that you&#x27;re really worried about when you&#x27;re trading. You&#x27;re always worried about your reward and your risks. How much money you can make, and how much money you can potentially lose. With every trade, obviously that&#x27;s what people are interested in.</p>
        <p><a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">Take Profit</a> and <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">Stop Loss</a> deal with these things. Now when you&#x27;re trading, you don&#x27;t want to sit at your computer all the time saying, right, if it gets from 100 to 110, I&#x27;m going to take my money. On the other side, you don&#x27;t want to think, my God, what if I leave, and I just lose all my money. It&#x27;s horrible.</p>
        <p>So, <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">Take Profit</a> and <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">Stop Loss</a> are automatic ways to... With a Take Profit, it automatically takes profit, cashes out, yeah, give me the money, when you reach a certain point, which you predetermined. And with a Stop Loss, it automatically cuts you out of the trade and thinks, alright, I&#x27;ve lost enough, I&#x27;ve pre-specified that if I lose $10 on this, I want to close it. It automatically does that when you&#x27;re not at your computer.</p>
        <p>So, you can go out and have a walk, have a swim, get a coffee, and not have to worry that you&#x27;re going to lose everything. So, right, this is a <a href="../../video/etoro-virtual-practice-account/">virtual account</a> I&#x27;m on at the moment. If I go to the Trade Markets, and I look for... Let&#x27;s look for Tesla.</p>
        <p>Right, so this is some company you might want to buy, some stocks, some shares you might want to buy. I press the Trade button and let&#x27;s say I want to buy $100, okay, and I&#x27;m going to use No Leverage. We&#x27;ll talk about that later. So, here you see some of the things which you can set when you make a new trade, you open a new trade.</p>
        <h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2>
        <p>It&#x27;s as if you&#x27;re trading manually, okay. When you&#x27;re copying people, it&#x27;s a bit different. But, alright, so I&#x27;m opening this trade with Tesla, and I want to buy $100 worth of Tesla. So, I can set the <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">Take Profit</a> at $50, you know.</p>
        <p>So, automatically, if it gets to $150, it will close the trade, and it will cash me out, and I&#x27;ll have made $50, and I don&#x27;t have to do anything. I can be away, swimming, doing something, and it will automatically close the trade for me. I can either set it as a cash amount, or as a rate, 50% of the position. So, that will be an actual...</p>
        <p>At the moment, it&#x27;s at $305.96. It&#x27;s saying that $456.442, I will automatically close this trade for you, and, you know, you&#x27;ll take your profit. I want to see it in cash, so it&#x27;s $50. That&#x27;s your <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">Take Profit</a>.</p>
        <p>It takes your profit automatically. When you reach a certain level, you&#x27;re buying, you want the stock to go up. If it does get up to a certain point, you&#x27;ve automatically set it, so that it takes the money, puts that into your account, and closes the trade. It means you can go out, and you won&#x27;t miss potential earnings.</p>
        <p><a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">Stop Loss</a>. Stop Loss is the other way. Whenever you trade, you&#x27;re measuring the risk. I don&#x27;t want to lose my money, and the reward.</p>
        <h2 id="what-tom-found">What Tom Found</h2>
        <p>Yay, give me some more money. So, the <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">Take Profit</a> deals with taking your reward when you reach a point that you&#x27;ve set beforehand. <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">Stop Loss</a> deals with your risk, okay. So, Stop Loss is saying, alright, let&#x27;s say I do go out, and I&#x27;m having tea with my friends, or coffee, or going for a swim, or whatever I&#x27;m doing.</p>
        <p>And, I&#x27;m out, and meanwhile, I&#x27;m losing money. I&#x27;m losing money hand over fist. I don&#x27;t want to lose it all, and I don&#x27;t want to have to sit in front of the machine, all the time, just going... Closing the trade manually.</p>
        <p><a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">Stop Loss</a> can help you with that. When you click here, the Stop Loss, the same stuff comes up. So, this is saying, if I lose $50, so I&#x27;ve bought $100, if it goes down to $50, just close this trade, okay. I don&#x27;t want it...</p>
        <p>Nothing else, that&#x27;s my decision, close the trade. Again, you can set it as a rate, so at the moment, it&#x27;s at $305.86. If it gets down to $155.33, that number, by the way, is a value of the stock on the actual stock exchanges. It&#x27;s the number it&#x27;s at.</p>
        <p>We can convert that to money though. If it loses $50, get me out of it. It means you can go away, and do whatever you want, and not risk all of your money. You can set that, you can say, I want to...</p>
        <h2 id="going-deeper">Going Deeper</h2>
        <p>I&#x27;ll risk $15, alright, so if I lose $15, close it, and I go to my <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a>, but only cash out if I make $30, alright. So, you can open that trade. Boom. So, that&#x27;s it, I&#x27;ve opened the trade.</p>
        <p>Buy Tesla position opened at $305.99. So, now, if I go to my portfolio, and I look down, there&#x27;s Tesla. These are those numbers I was talking about earlier, the actual value of it on the stock market. If I go into that trade, I can see here, I&#x27;ve bought $100.33 units.</p>
        <p>I opened at this price, the current is this, $305.33, so it&#x27;s gone down. There&#x27;s my <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>, there&#x27;s my <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a>. So, I can change them. At any time, I can go back into the trade, I can edit it, and I can readjust those, however I want.</p>
        <p>Brilliant thing, very simple, means I just don&#x27;t have to sit at my computer all the time, and I can sort of predetermine where I hope it will go, or think it will go, and what I&#x27;m, you know, willing to risk, what I&#x27;m willing to lose. There&#x27;s another thing which is called a trailing <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>. So, a trailing stop loss is really quite clever. Trailing stop loss means, let&#x27;s say I buy it at $100, and I&#x27;m willing to lose $10.</p>
        <p>So, I set my <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> at $10. So, the value might go up, and up, and up, and up, and up, so I&#x27;ve got like $300. Yay! But the stop loss will only be triggered if it gets to $10 below where I bought it, you know, so $90.</p>
        <h2 id="more-details">More Details</h2>
        <p>That&#x27;s a bit useless. So, a trailing <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> follows your profits. A trailing stop loss says, if at any point, it goes down $10, close it, okay. So, it doesn&#x27;t stick to the beginning.</p>
        <p>I bought at $100, if I lose $10, I&#x27;m at $90, close it. It doesn&#x27;t stick to the $90. It can keep going up, so I&#x27;ve made $150, yay! If it goes down to $140, close it.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;ve made $200, if it goes down to $190, close it. So, the trailing <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> follows upwards. If at any point, it goes below $10, I lose $10, it automatically closes. And it&#x27;s a way of locking in your victories, you know, it means like, let&#x27;s say, I bought at $100, I&#x27;ve gone off my tee, I set a trailing stop loss of $10.</p>
        <p>So, initially, that would mean it would close if it gets to $90. But I&#x27;ve gone off, I&#x27;m wandering around, I&#x27;m, you know, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing, off-road, bike riding or something. I don&#x27;t do that, but, you know, so I&#x27;m off doing something, and the value&#x27;s going up. And after half an hour, I&#x27;ve made $50.</p>
        <p>After, you know, a day, I&#x27;ve made $100, but I&#x27;m not watching. It would be sad, if after three days, I came back, and it&#x27;s gone back down to $100, and at one point, I was up at $300, and I just wasn&#x27;t in front of my computer, so I couldn&#x27;t close the trade. Trading <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>, trailing stop loss, would let that happen. It would mean that whilst I&#x27;m out riding the bike around, having fun all the time, it went down $10, but it closed it from $300, I was at $300, it went down to $290, it closed the trade for me, because I set a trailing stop loss, now I&#x27;ve locked in that profit.</p>
        <h2 id="further-thoughts">Further Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Magnificent, and it gives you a lot of peace of mind. Now, that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re trading manually, if you&#x27;re actually making the trades yourself, opening and closing positions. With copying people, which is kind of what I do, you know, to be honest, I don&#x27;t want to be doing this stuff. I&#x27;m not that good at it.</p>
        <p>I want to find people, I&#x27;m here to find people who are better than me at doing this, and just copy them. Automatically set my system to copy them. So, with that, if you look again at my portfolio, let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s this woman, Cookie. So, I&#x27;m copying her.</p>
        <p>She&#x27;s making trades, she&#x27;s winning some, she&#x27;s losing others. I can set a copy <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>. Now, a copy stop loss is different. Let&#x27;s say I put $100 on this trader, Cookie, okay.</p>
        <p>So, what I can set when I copy her, is I can say, if she ever loses 40% of the money I put in with her. So, if it&#x27;s $100, if she loses $40, the value of it, I don&#x27;t care what she&#x27;s buying and selling. I only care if she gets results, you know, and doesn&#x27;t lose all my money. If she ever loses 40% of my money, stop the copy.</p>
        <p>There&#x27;s no <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a>. So, I don&#x27;t say, if she ever makes $200, stop copying her. No, no, no. If she makes $200, keep copying her.</p>
        <h2 id="the-full-picture">The Full Picture</h2>
        <p>It&#x27;s great. I only want to stop copying them. If someone else is making more money, then I&#x27;ll go copy that guy instead. Or, if they&#x27;re losing money, then I want to stop the copy.</p>
        <p>But I don&#x27;t stop individual trades. I stop copying her as a whole. With <a href="../../copy-trading.html">copy trading</a>, you sort of trust the person overall. They may make 20 trades a day.</p>
        <p>They may make one trade a week. What I care about is whether, overall, they&#x27;re making profit, or they&#x27;re losing me money. As long as they&#x27;re making profit, I don&#x27;t care how they trade, what they trade. They do commodities, they do stocks, they do forex.</p>
        <p>I don&#x27;t care. What I&#x27;m looking at is their statistics to analyse, are they making money overall. So, a copy stop-loss is a different thing from a normal stop-loss. It treats the person you&#x27;re copying like a fund.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;m not caring about individual things, I&#x27;m caring about the overall, them as a person. I either copy them, or I don&#x27;t. If they lose this amount of money, stop copying them. That&#x27;s something I can say.</p>
