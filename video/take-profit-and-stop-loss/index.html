        <h2 id="in-this-video">In This Video</h2>
        <p>Alright, so <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a> and <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> deal with two things that you&#x27;re really worried about when you&#x27;re trading. You&#x27;re always worried about your reward and your risks. How much money you can make and how much money you can potentially lose with every trade. Obviously, that&#x27;s what people are interested in.</p>
        <p><a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">Take profit</a> and <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> deal with these things. Now, when you&#x27;re trading, you don&#x27;t want to sit at your computer all the time saying, right, if it gets from 100 to 110, I&#x27;m going to take my money. On the other side, you don&#x27;t want to think, my God, what if I leave and I just lose all my money? It&#x27;s horrible.</p>
        <p>So <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a> and <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> are automatic ways to, with a take profit, it automatically takes profit, cashes out, yeah, give me the money when you reach a certain point, which you predetermined. And with a stop loss, it automatically cuts you out of the trade and thinks, all right, I&#x27;ve lost enough. I&#x27;ve pre-specified. If I lose $10 on this, I want to close it.</p>
        <p>It automatically does that when you&#x27;re not at your computer. So you can go out and have a walk, have a swim, get a coffee and not have to worry that you&#x27;re going to lose everything. So, right, this is a <a href="../../video/etoro-virtual-practice-account/">virtual account</a> I&#x27;m on at the moment. If I go to the trade markets and I look for, let&#x27;s look for Tesla.</p>
        <p>Right, so this is some company you might want to buy some stocks, some shares you might want to buy. I press the trade button. And let&#x27;s say I want to buy $100. Okay.</p>
        <h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2>
        <p>And I&#x27;m going to use no leverage. I&#x27;ll talk about that later. So here you see some of the things which you can set when you make a new trade, you open a new trade. This is if you&#x27;re trading manually.</p>
        <p>Okay. When you&#x27;re copying people, it&#x27;s a bit different. All right. So I&#x27;m opening this trade with Tesla and I want to buy $100 worth of Tesla.</p>
        <p>So I can set the <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a>. Ah. At $50, you know. So automatically if it gets $150, it will close the trade and it will cash me out.</p>
        <p>And I would make $50 and I don&#x27;t have to do anything. I can be away swimming, doing something and it will automatically close the trade for me. I can either set it as a cash amount or as a rate. 50% of the position. So that will be an actual, at the moment it&#x27;s at $305.96.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s saying that $456.442. I will automatically close this trade for you and you know, you&#x27;ll <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a>. I want to see it in cash. So it&#x27;s $50.</p>
        <h2 id="what-tom-found">What Tom Found</h2>
        <p>That&#x27;s your <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a>. It takes your profit automatically. When you reach a certain level, you&#x27;re buying, you want the stock to go up. If it does get up to a certain point, you&#x27;ve automatically set it so that it takes the money, puts that into your account, closes the trade.</p>
        <p>It means you can go out and you won&#x27;t miss potential earnings. <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">Stop loss</a>. Stop loss is the other way. Whenever you trade, you&#x27;re measuring the...</p>
        <p>Risk. I don&#x27;t want to lose my money and the reward. Yeah, give me some more money. So the <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a> deals with taking your reward when you reach a point that you&#x27;ve set beforehand.</p>
        <p><a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">Stop loss</a> deals with your risk. Okay. So stop loss is saying, alright, let&#x27;s say I do go out and I&#x27;m having tea with my friends or coffee or going for a swim or whatever I&#x27;m doing. And I&#x27;m out.</p>
        <p>And meanwhile, I&#x27;m losing money. I&#x27;m losing money hand over fist. I don&#x27;t want to lose it all. And I don&#x27;t want to have to sit in front of the machine.</p>
        <h2 id="going-deeper">Going Deeper</h2>
        <p>I don&#x27;t want to lose it all. I don&#x27;t want to have to sit in front of the machine all the time just going... Closing the trade manual. <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">Stop loss</a> can help you with that.</p>
        <p>When you click here, the <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>, the same stuff comes up. So this is saying if I lose $50, so I&#x27;ve bought 100, if it goes down to 50, just close this trade. Okay, I don&#x27;t want nothing else. That&#x27;s my decision.</p>
        <p>Close the trade. Again, you can set it as a rate. So at the moment, it&#x27;s at 305.86. If it gets down to 155.33.</p>
        <p>That number, by the way, is a value of the stock on the actual stock exchanges. It&#x27;s the number it&#x27;s at. We can convert that to money though. If it loses $50, get me out of it.</p>
        <p>It means you can go away and do whatever you want and not risk all of your money. You can set that. You can say I want to... I&#x27;ll risk $15.</p>
        <h2 id="more-details">More Details</h2>
        <p>All right. So if I lose $15, close it. And I go to my <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a>. But only cash out if I make $30.</p>
        <p>All right. So you can open that trade. Boom. So that&#x27;s it.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;ve opened the trade. Buy Tesla position opened at 305.99. So now if I go to my portfolio and I look down, there&#x27;s Tesla. These are those numbers I was talking about earlier, the actual value of it on the stock market.</p>
        <p>If I go into that trade, I can see here I&#x27;ve bought $100.33 units. I opened at this price. The current is this, 305.33. So it&#x27;s gone down.</p>
        <p>There&#x27;s my <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>. There&#x27;s my <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a>. So I can change them. At any time, I can go back into the trade.</p>
        <h2 id="further-thoughts">Further Thoughts</h2>
        <p>I can edit it. And I can readjust those however I want. Brilliant thing. Very simple.</p>
        <p>It means I just don&#x27;t have to sit at my computer all the time. And I can sort of predetermine where I hope it will go or think it will go and what I&#x27;m, you know, willing to risk, what I&#x27;m willing to lose. There&#x27;s another thing which is called a trailing <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>. So a trailing stop loss is really quite clever.</p>
        <p>Trailing <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> means I can make a trade. I can make a trade. I can make a trade. A trailing stop loss means, let&#x27;s say I buy it at $100 and I&#x27;m willing to lose $10.</p>
        <p>So I set my <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> at $10. So the value might go up and up and up and up and up. So I&#x27;ve got like $300. Yay!</p>
        <p>But the <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> will only be triggered if it gets to $10 below where I bought it, you know, so $90. That&#x27;s a bit useless. So a trailing stop loss follows your profits. A trailing stop loss says if at any point...</p>
        <h2 id="the-full-picture">The Full Picture</h2>
        <p>If at any point it goes down $10, close it. Okay? So it doesn&#x27;t stick to the beginning. I bought at $100.</p>
        <p>If I lose $10, I&#x27;m at $90, close it. It doesn&#x27;t stick to the $90. It can keep going up. So I&#x27;ve made $150.</p>
        <p>Yay! If it goes down to $140, close it. I&#x27;ve made $200. If it goes down to $190, close it.</p>
        <p>So the trailing <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> follows upwards. If at any point it goes below $10, I lose $10, it automatically closes. And it&#x27;s a way of locking in your victories, you know. It means like, let&#x27;s say I bought at $100.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;ve gone off my tee. I set a trailing <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> of $10. So initially that would mean it would close if it gets to $90. But I&#x27;ve gone off.</p>
        <h2 id="tom-s-conclusion">Tom&#x27;s Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I&#x27;m wandering around. I&#x27;m, you know, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing. Off-road bike riding or something. I don&#x27;t do that.</p>
        <p>But, you know. So I&#x27;m off doing something and the value&#x27;s going up. And after half an hour, I&#x27;ve made $50. After, you know, a day, I&#x27;ve made $100.</p>
        <p>But I&#x27;m not watching. It would be sad if after three days I came back and it&#x27;s gone back down to $100. And at one point, I was up at $300. And I just wasn&#x27;t in front of my computer so I couldn&#x27;t close the trade.</p>
        <p>Trading <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>, trailing stop loss would let that happen. It would mean that whilst I&#x27;m out riding the bike around, having a fun old time, it went down $10. But it closed it from $300. I was at $300.</p>
        <p>It went down to $290. It closed the trade for me because I said, you know. It closed the trade for me because I said it&#x27;s a trailing <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>. Now I&#x27;ve locked in that profit.</p>
        <p>Magnificent. And it gives you a lot of peace of mind. Now that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re trading manually. If you&#x27;re actually making the trades yourself.</p>
        <p>Opening and closing positions. With copying people, which is kind of what I do, you know. To be honest, I don&#x27;t want to be doing this stuff. I&#x27;m not that good at it.</p>
        <p>I want to find people. I&#x27;m here to find people who are better than me at doing this. And just copy them. Automatically set my system up.</p>
        <p>Automatically set my system to copy them. So with that, if you look again at my portfolio. Let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s this woman, Cookie. So I&#x27;m copying her.</p>
        <p>She&#x27;s making trades. She&#x27;s winning some. She&#x27;s losing others. I can set a copy <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>.</p>
        <p>Now copy <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> is different. Let&#x27;s say I put $100 on this trader, Cookie. Okay. So what I can set when I copy her is I can say, If she ever, loses 40% of the money I put in with her.</p>
        <p>So if it&#x27;s $100. If she loses $40, the value of it. I don&#x27;t care what she&#x27;s buying and selling. I only care if she makes, gets results, you know.</p>
        <p>And doesn&#x27;t lose all my money. If she ever loses 40% of my money, stop the copy. There&#x27;s no <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a>. So I don&#x27;t say if she ever makes $200, stop copying her.</p>
        <p>No, no, no. If she makes $200, keep copying her. It&#x27;s great. I only want to stop copying them.</p>
        <p>If someone else is making more money, then I&#x27;ll go copy that guy instead. Or if they&#x27;re losing money, then I want to stop the copy. But I don&#x27;t stop individual trades. I stop copying her as a whole.</p>
        <p>With <a href="../../copy-trading.html">copy trading</a>, you sort of trust the person overall. They may make 20 trades a day. They may make one trade a week. What I care about is whether overall they&#x27;re making profit or they&#x27;re losing me money.</p>
        <p>As long as they&#x27;re making profit, I don&#x27;t care how they trade, what they trade. They do commodities. They do stocks. They do Forex.</p>
        <p>They do things. They don&#x27;t care. What I&#x27;m looking at is their statistics to analyze, are they making money overall? So a copy <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> is a different thing from a normal stop loss.</p>
        <p>It treats the person you&#x27;re copying like a fund. I&#x27;m not caring about individual things. I&#x27;m caring about the overall them as a person. I either copy them or I don&#x27;t.</p>
        <p>If they lose this amount of money, stop copying them. That&#x27;s something I can set. There we are.</p>
