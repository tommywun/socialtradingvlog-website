        <h2 id="in-this-video">In This Video</h2>
        <p>Hey everyone. So, in the first video, I talked about what are dividends in general, and do we get them on eToro? Yes. You can see the video up here, if you missed that one.</p>
        <p>And in the second video, I went over what makes us eligible to get them. How do we get these dividends? How frequently will we get given these dividends? And how much will we get?</p>
        <p>You know, it&#x27;s awesome. It&#x27;s going to be in the second video, watch that one. To carry on from that one, in the last one, I showed you this. This was Coca-Cola&#x27;s statistics page.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s where we can find information about dividends. And I showed here, here&#x27;s the dividend amount. We get $1.56 dividend annually, per share of Coca-Cola that we own. Now, do we get that full amount of the dividend?</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the answer is no. eToro makes a little bit of profit off the dividends. So, if I go here to eToro&#x27;s Does eToro Pay Dividends page, we can see here that for stocks and ETFs, if you hold the buy position, you will be credited with 70%. We only get 70% of the gross dividend for US listed stocks, NASDAQ and NYSE exchanges. So, there we are.</p>
        <h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2>
        <p>US, we get 70% of it, and 85% for all other stocks. So, 85% for all other stocks, 70% if it&#x27;s a US stock. Just the way that eToro are making a little bit of money there on that. Now, if we hold the sell position, remember I said that if we&#x27;re holding a buy position, then when the dividend comes out, it&#x27;s good for us, we get that dividend.</p>
        <p>If we&#x27;re holding a sell position in the stock, when the dividend comes out, it&#x27;s bad for us, we take an extra bit of a hit, and we&#x27;ll get given 100% of that loss, that hit will be given to us. So, 70% of the dividend, if we&#x27;re winning, if we&#x27;re going to receive it, but if it&#x27;s going to be deducted from our account, then it&#x27;s 100% that&#x27;s deducted, which, you know, there we go. Now, obviously, that applies to stocks and ETFs. If you don&#x27;t know what an ETF is, an ETF is a basket of stocks or assets.</p>
        <p>Instead of having individual ones, you get a lot of them, and an ETF is an exchange-traded fund, so the fund manager has put lots of them into one basket, and you&#x27;re betting the overall value of all of them will go up or down. Now, if one of those things in your basket, one of those individual stocks, has its dividend date, then a small proportion of that will be added, you know, to you as well. But it&#x27;s going to be a much smaller amount, proportionally, than if you just had one stock. Same for indices.</p>
        <p>If you have indices, indices track big groups of stocks. So, the Nasdaq 100, or the German 30, that&#x27;s 30 stocks, 100 stocks, you know, the FTSE 100, 100 stocks. Same there, if one of those stocks which the index is tracking, has its dividend date, that will be passed on to you as well. Again, you&#x27;ll get 75% on indices if you&#x27;re in a buy position, and if you&#x27;re selling the indice, you&#x27;ll get 100% of the gross dividend will be deducted, but only as a proportion, only the stock within that indice which has its dividend date, alright.</p>
        <p>So, we don&#x27;t get it all, we don&#x27;t get it all. We get, you know, a lot, but we don&#x27;t get it all. So, back to this Coca-Cola. The next thing I wanted to talk about was short-term trading.</p>
        <h2 id="what-tom-found">What Tom Found</h2>
        <p>So, as I talked about, basically dividends are, sort of, set up for the longer-term investors. They want secure investments over a long period of time, and if you don&#x27;t know much about leverage, I made a series of videos on leverage, and you know, how it incurs charges and fees. So, if you&#x27;re going to hold something for a very long time, you generally won&#x27;t be using a lot of leverage, you know. These guys want to, sort of, leave it in there, times one leverage, leave it in there for six months, a year, five years, ten years, and gradually get those dividends, plough them back in, and they&#x27;ll accumulate, you know, compounded profit, you know.</p>
        <p>Now, short-term people are thinking a different thing. I had the same idea. I thought, well, why can&#x27;t I just buy it the day before the ex-dividend date, you know. I&#x27;ll buy it, find out what that is in the last videos.</p>
        <p>The day before the ex-dividend date, I&#x27;ll buy the stock, I&#x27;ll wait until the next day, until it issues its dividend, I&#x27;ll take that dividend, I&#x27;ll close my position, get my money back from the stock, and boom, it&#x27;s like a free money-making machine. Everyone would be doing it. If it was that easy, I&#x27;d be at it, you&#x27;d be at it, the whole world would be at it, and, you know, it would work then. So, it&#x27;s not that easy, and here&#x27;s why.</p>
        <p>So, if I go to, for instance, this company, CVS. Now, CVS Health Corp is a company which does give out dividends, and it just so happens that its dividend came out today. So, anyone who had bought the stock before, yesterday, on eToro, was entitled to the dividend today, if they were buying, remember. So, let&#x27;s look at the chart of what happened today with them.</p>
        <p>So, let&#x27;s say this is today, this is on one day. So, each one of these bars represents one day, okay. So, yesterday, it&#x27;s going up, it&#x27;s going up. I&#x27;d say I&#x27;d bought it yesterday.</p>
        <h2 id="going-deeper">Going Deeper</h2>
        <p>I&#x27;d invested in CVS, because the next day, today, I wanted to get my dividend. So, I bought it, and it&#x27;s going up, and it&#x27;s going up. Now, this is where the price closed yesterday. The close of trade yesterday, it was there.</p>
        <p>Now, today, for some reason, boom, it magically opened lower. It gapped down. Gapped down means the price closing yesterday, there&#x27;s a big gap, and it&#x27;s surprisingly down, and there&#x27;s a gap here. That&#x27;s the gapping down, okay.</p>
        <p>Why did that happen? So, on the day that a company issues its dividend, the price will often gap down. This gap is because that money that went out to the investors, they paid the dividends, that money has to go somewhere, and it&#x27;s reflected in their share price, alright. So, it gapped down.</p>
        <p>So, let&#x27;s say you opened it yesterday, yay, we&#x27;re going up, we&#x27;re going up, we&#x27;re going up. Boom, today comes, you&#x27;ve got your dividend from holding that stock. Dividend, depending on how many shares you have, you have more or less dividend. But, the value of the actual stock is lower.</p>
        <p>So, did the amount you get from the dividend, was it more than the money you lost because the value of the stock went down? And it&#x27;s continued to go down, you see, today. And that&#x27;s the thing, that&#x27;s the tricky bit. You know, if this just kept on going higher, and we had also got the dividend, and we could just close it higher, that would be awesome.</p>
        <h2 id="more-details">More Details</h2>
        <p>But it doesn&#x27;t. When they release the dividend, it gaps down to reflect that loss of money from the company, and then, you know, maybe it goes up, maybe it goes down, we don&#x27;t know. But, you see the risk, you see. So, sometimes there&#x27;s...</p>
        <p>On the normal markets, we trade during the day, we have our trading hours on eTorrent. But, just before the market opens, and just after it closes, each day, there&#x27;s these special times which are only available to the big kids, not to us. They&#x27;re called pre-market trading and after-market trading. Now, sometimes, in pre-market trading, this can close here the next day, they release the dividend, but in pre-market trading, it&#x27;s already made its way back up.</p>
        <p>That can happen, you know, and then when the market&#x27;s open, we see it start from here. Great for us, but very often, it can gap down, you see. Now, another problem with that, the long-term investor who&#x27;s into dividends, he&#x27;s using 1x leverage. But, people, when they use short-term stuff, they want to buy...</p>
        <p>Let&#x27;s say we go to CVS here, I&#x27;m going to go into my virtual portfolio so I can do this, and we&#x27;re on CVS, and I want to trade CVS, I want to buy some. So, I&#x27;m going to go buy, and I want to buy $500 worth of CVS, okay, because tomorrow, it&#x27;s going to have its dividend, and I want to get in today, alright. So, times 1, I get 7.7 units, alright. Great for the long-term investor, but I, as a new investor, think no, no, no, I&#x27;m going to use more leverage.</p>
        <p>Times 2 leverage, now I&#x27;ve got 15.4 units. So remember, the dividend is paid on each unit, so it makes sense to have more units in some of our minds, you know. Or even times 5 leverage, now I&#x27;ve got 38 units, I&#x27;m going to get more dividend. So, I open my trade, and boom, boom, boom.</p>
        <h2 id="further-thoughts">Further Thoughts</h2>
        <p>The problem with that is that when you use leverage, I&#x27;m going to go back to the real portfolio, when you use leverage, as I said in those videos I made earlier, it&#x27;ll amplify how quickly you will make money, but also amplify how quickly you will lose money. So, a lot of people, or some people, try this system of buying it the day before, they use a lot of leverage because they think I&#x27;ll have more units, it opens the next day down, oh no. So, I&#x27;ve got more units, I&#x27;ve got more dividends, but as it&#x27;s losing money today, now this could have gone up, but look at it, it&#x27;s losing money today. So, the losses that they&#x27;re getting from actually holding onto that share still, will be amplified by the amount of leverage they use.</p>
        <p>Now, most retail investors, when they start trading, they lose money, most of them. The vast majority, statistically, of new traders lose money. One of the greatest things that contributes towards this loss of money, is using too much leverage before you know what&#x27;s going on, you know. And so, that is a big risk that can happen with new people trying to short-term trade around getting dividends from companies.</p>
        <p>So, why doesn&#x27;t this gap down, sort of, really worry the longer-term investor? Obviously, he&#x27;s invested in it as well, and he&#x27;s having the gap down. What&#x27;s the point in having these dividends? Well, the longer-term investor, he&#x27;s looking at the fundamentals of the company as a whole.</p>
        <p>He thinks that the company underlying, he&#x27;s looked at the fundamentals, the actual business of the company, how well it&#x27;s doing fundamentally, not just in terms of charts and technical analysis. And he believes that over the very long-term, this company is strong. So, these minor hits, he doesn&#x27;t worry about them. He believes it&#x27;s generally, it&#x27;s going to keep going up.</p>
        <p>He&#x27;s not in a shorter timeframe. He&#x27;s not using leverage, so he can wait, you know. That&#x27;s why he&#x27;s in a very different position from the short-term investor. He&#x27;s got to worry about this gap down.</p>
        <h2 id="the-full-picture">The Full Picture</h2>
        <p>He&#x27;s not looking at the fundamentals. He&#x27;s trying to do it in a short, get-rich-quicker type of way. The longer-term investor believes in the company underlying, he can just wait it out. It&#x27;s very different.</p>
        <p>Now, another thing people can do, is that they can find a stock which is already in trouble. The stock&#x27;s going down, they see the dividend date&#x27;s coming, and they think, well, hold on a minute. I know that when the dividend comes out, it&#x27;s going to gap down again. It will drop further.</p>
        <p>So, they buy it. They short-sell the stock. Now, remember, when the dividend comes out, if you&#x27;re short-selling a stock when the dividend comes out, the dividend&#x27;s against you. It means you&#x27;ll lose a bit of money.</p>
        <p>If you&#x27;re buying, you&#x27;ll make money from the dividend. If you&#x27;re losing, you&#x27;ll lose money from the dividend. But they say, well, I&#x27;ll absorb that loss, because I know it&#x27;s going to keep going lower, and then I can make even more money as the price goes lower. Very, very risky, especially if you&#x27;re using a lot of leverage.</p>
        <p>These are risky things to do. So, be careful. Obviously, I&#x27;m not a financial advisor. You know, what do I know?</p>
        <h2 id="tom-s-conclusion">Tom&#x27;s Conclusion</h2>
        <p>You do what you want, but it&#x27;s kind of been shown that some of these things can be very risky. Now, I talked about last time how we don&#x27;t know all the ex-dividend dates and things. It can be a bit difficult to find them, and not a lot of people are short-term trading. But, here on Etoro, there is someone who&#x27;s actually found, he&#x27;s searched through all of the dates when companies on Etoro have their ex-dividend date.</p>
        <p>So, when you have to buy them, so that the next day, you can actually get the dividends. And he&#x27;s made every day, he releases a little report. It&#x27;s this guy here, Christian Zewers, known as X-Parts, and he&#x27;s been helping me, thank you very much, with information about, you know, dividends in general, because it&#x27;s a complex subject. So, every day, he puts out this little report which shows which stocks have their dividends tomorrow, so that you can buy them today.</p>
        <p>It shows the amount per share that you&#x27;re going to get, and the yearly yield, so that people can, sort of, try this out for themselves, and see if they can short-term trade, maybe even long-term trade around dividends. It&#x27;s not something I do, and I can&#x27;t really endorse, or say it&#x27;s good or bad, it&#x27;s just something that&#x27;s there in the community, and he&#x27;s been very helpful, so I thought I&#x27;d show you that. So, there he is, at X-Parts, he&#x27;s up to that. So, that&#x27;s it with them, and the, sort of, risks of short-term trading.</p>
        <p>Obviously, it&#x27;s sort of, you know, you come across dividends more with the longer-term traders, you know. But, so, next thing, next video, I&#x27;m going to talk about, do we get dividends if we&#x27;re <a href="../../copy-trading.html">copy trading</a>? You know, I&#x27;m copying a lot of people, there are other people copying me. If someone you&#x27;re copying, gets dividends, does your copied trade also get dividends?</p>
        <p>Short answer is yes, but we&#x27;ll go into that in the next one. And also, a copy dividend. Now, some of you are copying people, might have seen that. You have received a copy dividend of $20 from Tom.</p>
        <p>Is that the same thing? No. It&#x27;s a completely separate thing, a copy dividend, and I&#x27;ll go into what that is, in the next video.</p>
