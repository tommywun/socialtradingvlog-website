        <h2 id="in-this-video">In This Video</h2>
        <p>Okay, so what I&#x27;m going to do now is I&#x27;m going to go and copy a trader. I&#x27;m going to find a trader to copy and show you how to copy him. Alright, so the first thing I do is I go to copy people. Little button on the left.</p>
        <p>And it sort of takes you into these profiles here, where you can look around. It&#x27;s really a social networking thing. So you can look around, you use the profiles, you can look around different traders. All of these guys are traders.</p>
        <p>Everyone here is actually here to trade, to make money, to learn off other people, or to copy other people. So how do I do it? So I can go into someone, wait till I find one which I really like. Let&#x27;s have a look at this guy here.</p>
        <p>So as I go in, the first thing I can see here is statistics. So what I&#x27;m always looking for is how well have they done, their statistics, how much money can they actually make, are they any good at this, is it worth copying them, and how much risk is this person going to give me. So the other part I can look at here is I can look at the risk score. So I can see, you know, how much out of 10 they score him on risk factors.</p>
        <p>They have very clever ways of doing this. Basically he&#x27;s a 3 out of 10, which is pretty good. And here, 2015, 16, 17. I don&#x27;t like the way he&#x27;s actually, you know, he&#x27;s made 80% last year.</p>
        <h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2>
        <p>Alright, so banks are giving sort of 2% maybe per year. This guy&#x27;s made 80% in a year, that&#x27;s obviously massive. What I&#x27;ll do is, I normally look around quite a lot. As someone who&#x27;s here to mostly do <a href="../../copy-trading.html">copy trading</a>, instead of actually sort of learning to trade myself, which I did a bit, but I lost money, so now I&#x27;m just copying people.</p>
        <p>My job here is to actually assess whether they&#x27;re good or not, rather than learn to trade or whatever. The skill I have to develop is to work out how to look at people&#x27;s statistics, how to look at people&#x27;s risk scores, and their trading style, and work out, can I trust this guy? Is this one a good bet, guy or girl? Everyone&#x27;s on here trading, from all over the world.</p>
        <p>Some of them are professionals, some of them, not professionals, but gifted. You&#x27;ve got to sift around and find those people. So this guy, I can see that he&#x27;s got 325 copiers, between 100 and 300,000 copy assets under management, so between 100,000 and 300,000 worth of money is being trusted to this guy. I can see that he trades currencies, indices, commodities, stocks.</p>
        <p>He&#x27;s mostly a currencies trader, okay? Currency pairs. Alright, so I like the look of this guy, I actually have seen this trader before, I&#x27;ve seen him in the past. What I&#x27;m going to do is I&#x27;m going to click this button here, copy button.</p>
        <p>Okay, so what it shows me is this screen here, where I&#x27;m going to choose to copy him with just $100, that&#x27;s the minimum you can copy him with. I&#x27;m going to do that for now. Here&#x27;s something called a <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>. So what this means is if basically he drops below $60, if he loses $40 of mine, it&#x27;s going to automatically uncopy him, it&#x27;s like a safety feature to make sure he doesn&#x27;t lose all my money.</p>
        <h2 id="what-tom-found">What Tom Found</h2>
        <p>And I&#x27;m not going to copy his open trades, so the next trade my system copies from him will be the next trade he places. Very clever system. So he&#x27;s not trading with my money, he&#x27;s trading with his own money. You know, he&#x27;s got his own money in this game, and my system is just copying whatever he does for free.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s amazing. So I&#x27;m going to press copy, and that&#x27;s it. Here, started copying trader 10. So he&#x27;s now someone that I can copy, and what I do is I can go to my portfolio here, every so often, however often I want, and I can check, you know, is he making money, is he doing well.</p>
        <p>So it&#x27;s on me to watch the people who I copy. If they make me money, I stay with them. If they start losing money, I find a new trader, or I just stop copying that one. It&#x27;s as simple as that.</p>
        <p>So I&#x27;ve got to do 10 of these overall. That&#x27;s the first one, and I&#x27;ll go find some more.</p>
