        <h2 id="in-this-video">In This Video</h2>
        <p>Hey everyone, so today I want to talk about a situation which has caught me out, and a lot of other people have seen. So when we&#x27;re making a trade, is there ever a time or a circumstance that can happen whereby we&#x27;ve set our <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>, but somehow our trade just blows straight through our stop loss, and we lose much more money than we sort of wanted to lose, or wanted to risk? The answer&#x27;s yes, and it&#x27;s because of a certain market condition called a gap down. Now, in order to explain what a gap down is, we have to go through how we set up a trade.</p>
        <p>So let&#x27;s say we want to set up a trade in Tesla, alright? We open up the dialogue screen, we can either buy the asset, which means we think the value&#x27;s going to go up, we want to make money as the price goes up, or we can sell the asset, which means we think the value&#x27;s going to go down, and we want to make money as the value goes down. In this example, I&#x27;m going to choose a buy trade, alright? What we can then do is we put in the amount of money that we want to spend.</p>
        <p>In this case, I&#x27;m going to spend $100 on Tesla. The next thing we have to look at is leverage. Now, leverage is just a way to sort of amplify our trade sizes. When people start trading, like me, we don&#x27;t have a lot of money, usually.</p>
        <p>The new retail investors, we don&#x27;t have a lot of cash to put in, so we often use leverage to amplify our trades. If I put in trade for $100, and I use x5 leverage, it&#x27;s as though I&#x27;m trading with $500 worth of stock, and this can get a lot of people into trouble. I made videos about that, about leverage, and about how most new retail investors get into trouble trading. But, we set our leverage, and this time we choose x5.</p>
        <p>We choose the maximum amount of leverage, because we haven&#x27;t got a lot of money, and we think, whatever, I&#x27;m going to try and make tons of money on this trade, alright? Next thing we can do, is we can set our <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>. Now, our stop loss is, again, another video, it&#x27;s an automatic switch. Instead of sort of sitting on the computer all day, twitchily watching the price, and making sure we don&#x27;t lose too much money, we can set a stop loss, which says to eToro, or whichever broker you&#x27;re using, I want you to automatically close this trade when I&#x27;ve lost $10, or $20, or $30.</p>
        <h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2>
        <p>In this case, I&#x27;ve set it at $20. So I&#x27;ve opened my $100 Tesla trade, it&#x27;s a buy trade, I&#x27;m using x5 leverage, because I want to make the most out of my money, as lots of new people. This is how we think when we&#x27;re new, very often. Statistically, it gets so many of us into trouble.</p>
        <p>So I&#x27;ve set x5 leverage, I&#x27;ve set my <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> at 20%, $20 in this case. So what I&#x27;m saying is that I have $100, I want to risk $20, if it ever gets to $80, or below, close my trade, I&#x27;m out. That means I should have $80 returned to my available balance, when the trade closes, alright? So that&#x27;s Monday.</p>
        <p>I set my trade, and I decide, right, that&#x27;s it, I&#x27;m just going to leave it. I&#x27;m not going to watch it, let&#x27;s see how it&#x27;s going. Now, by the end of the day, maybe I&#x27;m up a bit. Maybe I&#x27;m up at, you know, $106, I&#x27;ve made some profit.</p>
        <p>So I decide to leave this trade overnight. What can go wrong? Okay, so now it&#x27;s Tuesday, day 2. I come back to my laptop, I open it up, I look at eToro, I check my portfolio.</p>
        <p>All I had there before was my Tesla trade, and my portfolio&#x27;s empty. And not only is my portfolio empty, but I haven&#x27;t got $80. I think maybe my <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> triggered, maybe I lost my $20, but I haven&#x27;t lost $20. I&#x27;ve lost $40, or $60, or all of my $100.</p>
        <h2 id="what-tom-found">What Tom Found</h2>
        <p>So I&#x27;m just feeling confused. At this point, I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happened, I&#x27;ve lost a bunch of money, it hasn&#x27;t worked, I&#x27;m thinking this is a scam, something&#x27;s gone wrong. I remember this happening to me, I was super confused. This is where the gap down can come into play.</p>
        <p>Now, what I first had to understand is that the markets aren&#x27;t always open. Bear with me on this. When I first started trading, I thought the markets were open 24 hours a day. What do I mean by markets?</p>
        <p>So, Tesla, for instance, is traded on the Nasdaq. The Nasdaq is a huge American exchange, it&#x27;s kind of the home of Tesla. So, when the Nasdaq is open, it opens at a certain time in the morning, and it closes at a certain time in the evening, just like a shop. Now, during those times when it&#x27;s open, me, and you, and other retail investors, we can go on to our exchange, eToro, or wherever, and we can trade Tesla, because the Nasdaq, its home exchange, is actually open.</p>
        <p>We can only trade it during those times. Not before it&#x27;s open, not after it&#x27;s open. Not on the weekend, because it&#x27;s shut, okay? Now, is that the only time trading can occur?</p>
        <p>No. Now, before the markets are open, and after the markets are open, there&#x27;s a different set of people who are able to trade. They&#x27;re called the pre-market hours, and the after-market hours. So, what you&#x27;ve got, is you&#x27;ve got this chunk of time where we can trade.</p>
        <h2 id="going-deeper">Going Deeper</h2>
        <p>The actual, sort of, retail investor can trade. Before that, you&#x27;ve got another part of time called pre-market trading, where other people are trading, and moving the price of the asset up or down. Then there&#x27;s after-market trading, where people are moving the price of the market up and down. Now, why don&#x27;t we have access to these two?</p>
        <p>Certain brokers do give people access. On Etoro, we only have access to the actual market hours. Now, pre-market trading, and after-market trading, can be very risky for a variety of reasons, which we can go over in another video. But, we only have access to this, the normal market hours.</p>
        <p>So, we placed our trade for $100 on Tesla, some time in between the market open and market close, and by the time the market closed in the evening, we were up in profit. But, let&#x27;s say, after the market closes, some terrible news comes out about Tesla. Let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s some defect with all of their cars, or Elon Musk decides he&#x27;s going to leave the company, and someone else takes over, and the market massively loses confidence in Tesla, for whatever reason, okay. Or, there&#x27;s an earnings report, and Tesla was expected to make this much money, and it only made this much money.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s a huge shock to the whole market, and people suddenly value Tesla much lower. Now, the markets are closed, but after-market, people start trading. They start going, oh my god, and they start selling Tesla shares, and the price is going down, and down, and down. Now, if I look at my account on eToro, the price is going to stay the same, because the markets are closed, and the prices are only updated when the markets are actually open.</p>
        <p>The markets are closed, but the price in after-market trading is still dropping. The next day comes, and pre-market trading, the price is dropping, dropping, dropping, precipitously. Still, on eToro, because we can only see the price&#x27;s feeds updated when the markets are actually open, we still see the same price as when Tesla closed yesterday. Just to show you, actually, this in real life.</p>
        <h2 id="more-details">More Details</h2>
        <p>It&#x27;s 2.30 at the moment, in Italy. The markets will open in an hour, so in an hour&#x27;s time, the NASDAQ will open. Now, at the moment, if I look at the Tesla price on eToro, we can see it&#x27;s at 422.64. Now, that was the price that Tesla actually closed yesterday evening.</p>
        <p>The markets are closed, so it&#x27;s actually still showing that same price. If I go over to here, I&#x27;ve just typed into Google, Tesla pre-market price, okay. We can see that 422.64, there we are, there&#x27;s the price. Same as on eToro, 422.64.</p>
        <p>That&#x27;s showing the actual open market price. But, here&#x27;s where the market closed yesterday for Tesla, 422.64. Look at it. After-market, it went up to 436, then it went down, then it went up.</p>
        <p>This is the after-market trading from yesterday, and look how much it changed. It went from 422.64, all the way up to 436.24, in after-hours trading yesterday. Now, pre-market today, it&#x27;s at 444.1, .73. It&#x27;s up 19.09, it&#x27;s up 4.52%.</p>
        <p>So, this is the price it closed at yesterday. It&#x27;s still the price, right now, that it&#x27;s showing on eToro, but actually, the real price, at the moment, in pre-market, is 441.73. So, in an hour&#x27;s time, when the market&#x27;s open, this is going to change to reflect the actual price, taking into account the trading that happened after-market yesterday, and pre-market this morning. It&#x27;s quite a change, and it can have quite a big effect.</p>
        <h2 id="further-thoughts">Further Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Now, normally, prices don&#x27;t move this much. Normally, there isn&#x27;t big news, or some catastrophe with Tesla, or any other company. This can be especially around earnings reports, and if there is just unforeseen news. But those prices are changing, really, in real life, they&#x27;re changing.</p>
        <p>But on eToro, my prices aren&#x27;t changing. The price feed is not changing. And your stop-loss on eToro is linked to the live price feed from the NASDAQ. So, the thing is, the actual price of Tesla has gone down far below my 20% stop-loss, but on eToro, it can&#x27;t see that, because it can only see the live price feed.</p>
        <p>So, the price keeps going down after-market, pre-market is still going down. When the market&#x27;s open, when the NASDAQ opens the next day, on the Tuesday, when I had apparently lost all this money, then the price on eToro gets updated. All of a sudden, it realises that the price wasn&#x27;t where it was yesterday, on Monday, when the market&#x27;s closed. All of a sudden, it takes into account all that lowering price movement, after-hours and pre-market trading.</p>
        <p>At that point, my stop-loss tries to trigger. It sees that I&#x27;ve lost 20%. I haven&#x27;t lost 20%. I&#x27;ve lost much more than 20%.</p>
        <p>Now, the stop-loss doesn&#x27;t just trigger exactly where it should. If the price is alive, if the markets are open, and my trade on eToro hits 20%, it will close that trade, and I&#x27;ll be out of that trade, and it will stop my losses. But, if the price feed isn&#x27;t updating, because the markets are closed, it can&#x27;t close at 20%. It doesn&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s dropped below 20%.</p>
        <h2 id="the-full-picture">The Full Picture</h2>
        <p>So, it will close it, at the next best available price. So, the market opens, it sees the price is here, and it goes, wow, that&#x27;s below his 20%. Boom, close the trade. And that&#x27;s how I can lose much more money, than I wanted to risk, via setting my stop-loss.</p>
        <p>It can happen. I&#x27;ve seen it happen to a lot of people. So, we can see this in the charts. If you go to the charts, I&#x27;ve set my charts here to show one day.</p>
        <p>Each one of these bars shows a one day time frame. So, each one of those little bars, red or green, represents one day of trading. If the bar&#x27;s red, it means the price opened at the top of the red bar, and it closed at the bottom of the red bar. If the price is green, it means that asset went up in value that day, so the price opened at the bottom of the colour green, and it closed at the top of the colour green.</p>
        <p>Now, you can see certain examples, where the price there&#x27;s just a gap, in between yesterday&#x27;s closing price, and the next day&#x27;s opening price. That&#x27;s what a gap down is, that&#x27;s what it looks like on daily charts. So, how can we avoid this, as a risk? Alright, so, be aware of earnings reports.</p>
        <p>So, many people trade instruments like Tesla, assets like Tesla, they might trade them for a long time. In which case, earnings reports, they&#x27;ll come quarterly. It means you&#x27;re going to be trading through these earnings reports, but you plan to hold it, buy and hold it for a year, or six months, or five years, or whatever. That&#x27;s one thing.</p>
        <h2 id="tom-s-conclusion">Tom&#x27;s Conclusion</h2>
        <p>But, if you&#x27;re trading over a shorter time frame, you just want to buy Tesla and sell it next week, you think the price is going to go up a lot this week, make sure that there aren&#x27;t any earnings reports coming up. Because, earnings reports, when the company releases its financial data, and says how it did in the last quarter, these can often cause much more volatility in the markets. And at times like this, is when you can see these gaps down. Now, a gap down might not actually cause you too much trouble, if you&#x27;re not using leverage.</p>
        <p>That&#x27;s the other big thing to be aware of. If you&#x27;re trading with a lot of leverage, you&#x27;re amplifying the size of your trade. You&#x27;re also amplifying the effects of these gaps down. Now, the market can also gap up.</p>
        <p>It can close at this price, and the next day, it magically opens at a much higher price. Because, you know, the inverse has happened. Some great news has come out, or whatever. And overnight, it gaps up.</p>
        <p>Yay, I&#x27;ve made loads of money! But, as new investors, statistically, most people do lose money in trading. So, it&#x27;s always best to be aware of the risk. Certainly, it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve fallen into.</p>
        <p>Until you know what you&#x27;re doing, until I know what I&#x27;m doing, it&#x27;s best, I&#x27;ve found, not to take these massive risks. So, avoiding using a lot of leverage, and being aware, if there&#x27;s an earnings report coming out, can go a long way to mitigating and lessening this risk. Another thing we can do, is we can limit our position sizes. So, instead of, if I have $100 in my account, and I put $100 on Tesla, I&#x27;m taking a huge risk there.</p>
        <p>If I have $100 in my account, bear with me, this is just to demonstrate how it might work. I have $100 in my account, I only put $20 on Tesla, it&#x27;s less likely that potential disruptions, or volatility events like gaps down, can put all of my money at risk. So, using leverage around the times of earnings reports, scary. Using a lot of leverage, in general, if you&#x27;re new, very scary, because we&#x27;re not aware that these things can happen, and that even though we&#x27;ve set a stop-loss, it can blow past it.</p>
        <p>Now, to learn more about these gaps, and how we can trade around them, how can we take advantage of them, you can go to Investopedia, pages like this, which tell you all about the gap, what is a gap, the key takeaways, what does a gap tell you, the differences between different types of gaps... There are different types of gaps, and people use these sometimes, as their analysis for trading. If there&#x27;s a gap in a stock, what&#x27;s it likely to do in future, it depends on the type of gap. But there&#x27;s lots you can actually learn from pages like Wikipedia, about them, and learn more about it.</p>
        <p>But it is definitely something to be aware of, because it catches so many people out. Now, what happens if you&#x27;ve traded so much money, you&#x27;ve put so much money into a single asset, you&#x27;ve used as much leverage as you can, and the gap down is so significant, that you&#x27;ve lost far more money, not only than you put into that trade, but you&#x27;ve lost more money than your entire account size. Can you end up in a position where you owe Etoro money for this? Can you end up in a position where you&#x27;re risking your house, your farm, your whatever?</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s a problem that I had, it&#x27;s a real fear that I had, and I know a lot of other people have when they trade. Can anything happen? Can you make a trade so bad, so big, so foolish, so risky, or so unfortunate, that you actually end up in the red, owing Etoro money? The answer to that one, thankfully, is no, because of something called <a href="../../video/etoro-negative-balance-protection-most-you-can-lose/">negative balance protection</a>, which I&#x27;ll go into in the next video.</p>
        <p>We&#x27;ll also cover something called a margin call, which is when you&#x27;re... Let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s been a gap down, and you&#x27;ve lost a load of money, a tonne of money, more than your <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>, more than the actual value of that trade. You took the trade out for $100, you&#x27;ve lost $500, okay? Now, let&#x27;s say at the same time, you have other trades open in your account.</p>
        <p>Now, a margin call means that Etoro will actually close those other open trades that you have, to cover the losses of the trade which gap down. That can also happen. I&#x27;ll go into that, and the <a href="../../video/etoro-negative-balance-protection-most-you-can-lose/">negative balance protection</a>, in the next video. Hope that helped.</p>
        <p>Alright, take care. Don&#x27;t use too much leverage, especially if you&#x27;re new. Second month I was trading on Etoro, I lost 38% using too much leverage. It&#x27;s a massive risk.</p>
        <p>It catches out a lot of people. It can be useful. A lot of people use leverage successfully, but statistically, most new traders do lose money, and leverage does seem to be a major contributing factor to that. So, leverage combined with gaps down in the market, can cause some real problems.</p>
        <p>So, it&#x27;s kind of good to be aware of how they can happen. Alright, that&#x27;s it. See you next time. Bye.</p>
