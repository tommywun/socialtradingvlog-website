        <h2 id="in-this-video">In This Video</h2>
        <p>Hey everyone, so today I want to talk about a situation which has caught me out and a lot of other people I&#x27;ve seen. So when we&#x27;re making a trade, is there ever a time or a circumstance that can happen whereby we&#x27;ve set our <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> but somehow our trade just blows straight through our stop loss and we lose much more money than we sort of wanted to lose or wanted to risk? The answer is yes and it&#x27;s because of a certain market condition called a gap down. Now in order to explain what a gap down is, we have to go through how we set up a trade.</p>
        <p>So let&#x27;s say we want to set up a trade in Tesla, alright? We open up the dialogue screen, we can either buy the asset, which means we think the value is going to go up, we want to make money as the price goes up, or we can sell the asset, which means we think the value is going to go down and we want to make money as the value goes down. In this example, I&#x27;m going to choose a buy trade, alright? What we can then do is we put in the amount of money that we want to spend.</p>
        <p>In this case, I&#x27;m going to spend a hundred dollars on Tesla. The next thing we have to look at is leverage. Now leverage is just a way to sort of amplify our trade sizes. When people start trading, like me, we don&#x27;t have a lot of money usually, the new retail investors.</p>
        <p>We don&#x27;t have a lot of cash to put in. So we often use leverage to amplify our trades. If I put in trade for a hundred dollars and I use times five leverage, it&#x27;s as though I&#x27;m trading with five hundred dollars worth of stock. Now this can get a lot of people into trouble.</p>
        <p>I made videos about that, about leverage and about how most new retail investors get into trouble trading. But leverage in this time, we choose times five. We choose the maximum amount of leverage because we haven&#x27;t got a lot of money and we think whatever, I&#x27;m going to try and make tons of money on this trade. Alright?</p>
        <h2 id="key-points">Key Points</h2>
        <p>Next thing we can do is we can set our <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>. Now our stop loss is again another video. It&#x27;s an automatic switch. Instead of sort of sitting on the computer all day twitchily watching the price and making sure we don&#x27;t lose too much money, we can set a stop loss which says to eToro or whichever broker you&#x27;re using, I want you to automatically close this trade when I&#x27;ve lost $10 or $20 or $30.</p>
        <p>In this case, I&#x27;ve set it at $20. So I&#x27;ve opened my hundred dollar Tesla trade. It&#x27;s a buy trade. I&#x27;m using times five leverage because I want to make the most out of my money.</p>
        <p>As lots of new people, this is how we think when we&#x27;re new very often. Statistically, it gets so many of us into trouble. So I&#x27;ve set times five leverage. I&#x27;ve set my <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> at 20%, $20 in this case.</p>
        <p>So what I&#x27;m saying is that I have a hundred dollars. I want to risk 20 if it ever gets to $80 or below. So I close my trade. I&#x27;m out.</p>
        <p>That means I should have $80 return to my available balance when the trade closes. All right. So that&#x27;s Monday. I set my trade and I decide, right, that&#x27;s it.</p>
        <h2 id="what-tom-found">What Tom Found</h2>
        <p>I&#x27;m just going to leave it. I&#x27;m not going to watch it. Let&#x27;s see how it&#x27;s going. Now, by the end of the day, maybe I&#x27;m up a bit.</p>
        <p>Maybe I&#x27;m up at, you know, $106. I&#x27;ve made some profit. So I decide to leave this trade overnight. What can go wrong?</p>
        <p>Okay. So now it&#x27;s Tuesday, day two. I come back to my laptop. I open it up.</p>
        <p>I look at eToro. I check my portfolio. All I had there before was my Tesla trade. And my portfolio is empty.</p>
        <p>And not only is my portfolio empty, but I haven&#x27;t got $80. I think maybe my <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> triggered. Maybe I lost my $20, but I haven&#x27;t lost $20. I&#x27;ve lost $40 or $60 or all of my hundred dollars.</p>
        <h2 id="going-deeper">Going Deeper</h2>
        <p>So I&#x27;m just feeling confused at this point. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happened. I&#x27;ve lost a bunch of money. It hasn&#x27;t worked.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;m thinking this is a scam. Something&#x27;s gone wrong. I remember this happening to me. I was super confused.</p>
        <p>This is where the gap down can come into play. Now, what I first had to understand is that the markets aren&#x27;t always open. Bear with me. Bear with me on this.</p>
        <p>When I first started trading, I thought the markets were open 24 hours a day. What do I mean by markets? So Tesla, for instance, is traded on the Nasdaq. The Nasdaq is a huge American exchange.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s kind of the home of Tesla. So when the Nasdaq is open, it opens at a certain time in the morning and it closes at a certain time in the evening, just like a shop. Now, during those times when it&#x27;s open, me and you and other retail investors, we can go on to our exchange, eToro or wherever, and we can trade Tesla. Now, it&#x27;s home exchange is actually open.</p>
        <h2 id="more-details">More Details</h2>
        <p>We can only trade it during those times, not before it&#x27;s open, not after it&#x27;s open, not on the weekend because it&#x27;s shut. Okay. Now, is that the only time trading can occur? No.</p>
        <p>Now, before the markets are open and after markets are open, there&#x27;s a different set of people who are able to trade. They&#x27;re called the pre-market hours and the aftermarket hours. So what you&#x27;ve got is you&#x27;ve got this chunk of time where we can trade, the actual sort of retail investor can trade. Before you&#x27;ve got the pre-market hours, you&#x27;ve got another part of time called pre-market trading, where other people are trading and moving the price of the asset up or down.</p>
        <p>Then there&#x27;s aftermarket trading, where people are moving the price of the market up and down. Now, why don&#x27;t we have access to these two? Certain brokers do give people access. On eToro, we only have access to the actual market hours.</p>
        <p>Now, pre-market trading and aftermarket trading can be very risky for a variety of reasons, which we can go over in another video. But we only have access to this, the normal market hours. So we placed our trade for $100 on the other market hours. We already know that before폰 is taken to the market, shapcode is taken to unfatter funny stuff up here.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;m reflecting on this. This particular one here, the market is clear or was somehow clarified, but you can use, you know, assuredly versatility to forget things. Is this the only source of safety for any of the exactly said market hours, which, of course, is highly lucrative in the market also having half of the stock in the market. You can set the 47% off Buenoville up here for $130 an-year.</p>
        <h2 id="further-thoughts">Further Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Convenient. Andivescom.com. and people suddenly value Tesla much lower. Now the markets are closed but after market people start trading. They start going oh my god and they start selling Tesla shares and the price is going down and down and down.</p>
        <p>Now if I look at my account on eToro the price is going to stay the same because the markets are closed and the prices are only updated when the markets are actually open. The markets are closed but the price in after market trading is still dropping. The next day comes and pre-market trading the price is dropping dropping dropping precipitously still on eToro because we can only see the prices feeds updated when the markets are actually open. We still see the same price as when Tesla closed yesterday.</p>
        <p>Just to show you actually this in real life it&#x27;s 2.30 at the moment in Italy. The markets will open in an hour so in an hour&#x27;s time the Nasdaq will open. Now at the moment if I look at the Tesla price on eToro we can see it&#x27;s at 422.64. Now that&#x27;s a lot of money.</p>
        <p>Now if I look at the Tesla price on eToro we can see it&#x27;s at 422.64. Now that was the price that Tesla actually closed yesterday evening. The markets are closed so it&#x27;s actually still showing that same price. If I go over to here I&#x27;ve just typed into Google Tesla pre-market price.</p>
        <p>Okay we can see that 422.64 there we are there&#x27;s the price same as on eToro 422.64. That&#x27;s showing the actual open market price but here&#x27;s where the market closed yesterday for Tesla 422.64. Look at it after market it went up. It&#x27;s a 436 then it went down then it went up.</p>
        <h2 id="the-full-picture">The Full Picture</h2>
        <p>This is the after market trading from yesterday and look how much it changed. It went from 422.64 all the way up to 436.24 in after hours trading yesterday. Now pre-market today it&#x27;s at 444.1.73. It&#x27;s up 19.09.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s up 4.52 percent. So this is the price it closed at yesterday. It&#x27;s still the price right now that it&#x27;s showing on eToro but actually the real price at the moment in pre-market is 441.73. So in an hour&#x27;s time when the market&#x27;s open this is going to change to reflect the actual price taking into account the trading that happened after market yesterday and pre-market this morning.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s quite a change and it can have quite a big effect. Now normally prices don&#x27;t move this much. Normally there isn&#x27;t big news or some catastrophe with Tesla or any other company. This can be especially around earnings reports and if there is just unforeseen news.</p>
        <p>But those prices are changing really in real life they&#x27;re changing but on eToro my prices aren&#x27;t changing. The price feed is not changing and your <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> on eToro is linked to the live price feed from the Nasdaq. So the thing is the actual price of Tesla has gone down far below my 20 percent stop loss but on eToro it can&#x27;t see that because it can only see the live price feed. So the price keeps going down after market.</p>
        <p>Pre-market is still going down. Then when Nasdaq opens the next day on the Tuesday when I had apparently lost all this money then the price on itoro gets updated. All of a sudden it realises that the price wasn&#x27;t where it was yesterday on Monday when the markets closed. All of a sudden it takes into account all that lower classical movement after hours and pre-market trading at that point my <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> tries to trigger it.</p>
        <h2 id="tom-s-conclusion">Tom&#x27;s Conclusion</h2>
        <p>It sees that I&#x27;ve lost 20 percent. I haven&#x27;t lost twenty percent I&#x27;ve lost much more than twenty percent. Now the <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a> doesn&#x27;t just trigger exactly where it should. If the price is alive, if the markets are open, and my trade on eToro hits 20%, it will close that trade, and I&#x27;ll be out of that trade, and it will stop my losses.</p>
        <p>But if the price feed isn&#x27;t updating because the markets are closed, it can&#x27;t close at 20%. It doesn&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s dropped below 20%. So it will close it at the next best available price. So the market opens, it sees the prices here, and it goes, wow, that&#x27;s below his 20%.</p>
        <p>Boom, close the trade. And that&#x27;s how I can lose much more money than I wanted to risk by setting my <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>. It can happen. I&#x27;ve seen it happen to a lot of people.</p>
        <p>So we can see this in the charts. If you go to the charts, I&#x27;ve set my charts here to show one day. Each one of these bars shows a one-day time frame. So each one of those little bars, red or green, represents one day of trading.</p>
        <p>If the bar&#x27;s red, it means the price opened at the top of the red bar, and it closed at the bottom of the red bar. If the price is green, it means that asset went up in value that day. So the price opened at the bottom of the color green, and it closed at the top of the color green. Now, you can see certain examples where the price, there&#x27;s just a gap in between yesterday&#x27;s closing price and the next day&#x27;s opening price.</p>
        <p>That&#x27;s what a gap down is. That&#x27;s what it looks like on daily charts. So how can we avoid this as a risk? All right, so be aware of earnings reports.</p>
        <p>So many people trade instruments like Tesla, assets like Tesla. They might trade them for a long time, in which case earnings reports, they&#x27;ll come quarterly. It means you&#x27;re going to be trading through these earnings reports, but you plan to hold it, buy and hold it for a year, or six months, or five years, or whatever. That&#x27;s one thing.</p>
        <p>But if you&#x27;re trading over a shorter time frame, you just want to buy Tesla and sell it next week, you think the price is going to go up a lot this week, make sure that there aren&#x27;t any earnings reports coming up. Because earnings reports, when the company releases its financial data and says how it did in the last quarter, these can often cause much more volatility in the markets. And at times like this is when you can see these gaps. Now, a gap down might not actually cause you too much trouble if you&#x27;re not using leverage.</p>
        <p>That&#x27;s the other big thing to be aware of. If you&#x27;re trading with a lot of leverage, you&#x27;re amplifying the size of your trade. You&#x27;re also amplifying the effects of these gaps down. Now, the market can also gap up.</p>
        <p>It can close at this price and the next day it magically opens at a much higher price because the inverse has happened. Some great news has come out or whatever. And overnight it gaps up. Yay, I&#x27;ve made loads of money.</p>
        <p>But as new levels of market are coming up, it&#x27;s going to be a lot harder. So you&#x27;re going to have to be very careful. As new investors, statistically, most people do lose money in trading. So it&#x27;s always best to be aware of the risk.</p>
        <p>Certainly, it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve fallen into. Until you know what you&#x27;re doing, until I know what I&#x27;m doing, it&#x27;s best, I&#x27;ve found, not to take these massive risks. So avoiding using a lot of leverage and being aware if there&#x27;s an earnings report coming out can go a long way to sort of mitigating and lessening this risk. Another thing we can do is we can limit our position sizes.</p>
        <p>So instead of if I have $100. In my account and I put $100 on Tesla, I&#x27;m taking a huge risk there. If I have $100 in my account, bear with me. This is just to demonstrate how it might work.</p>
        <p>I have $100 in my account. I only put $20 on Tesla. It&#x27;s less likely that potential disruptions or volatility events like gaps down can put all of my money at risk. So using leverage around the times of earnings reports, scary.</p>
        <p>Using a lot of leverage in general if you&#x27;re new, very scary. Because we&#x27;re not aware of the risk. So we&#x27;re not aware of the risk. We&#x27;re not aware that these things can happen.</p>
        <p>And that even though we&#x27;ve set a <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>, it can blow past it. Now to learn more about these gaps and how we can trade around them, how can we take advantage of them, you can go to Investopedia, pages like this which tell you all about the gap. What is a gap? The key takeaways.</p>
        <p>What does a gap tell you? The differences between different types of gaps. There are different types of gaps. And people use these sometimes as their analysis for trading.</p>
        <p>If there&#x27;s a gap in a stock, what&#x27;s it likely to do in future? It depends on the type of gap. But there&#x27;s lots you can actually learn from pages. Like Wikipedia about them and learn more about it.</p>
        <p>But it is definitely something to be aware of because it catches so many people out. Now, what happens if you&#x27;ve traded so much money, you&#x27;ve put so much money into a single asset, you&#x27;ve used as much leverage as you can, and the gap down is so significant that you&#x27;ve lost far more money, not only than you put into that trade, but you&#x27;ve lost more money than your entire account size. Can you end up in a position where you owe eToro money for that? Can you end up in a position where you&#x27;re risking your house, your farm, your whatever?</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s a problem that I had. It&#x27;s a real fear that I had and I know a lot of other people have when they trade. Can anything happen? Can you make a trade so bad, so big, so foolish, so risky, or so unfortunate that you actually end up in the red, owing eToro money?</p>
        <p>The answer to that one, thankfully, is no because of something called <a href="../../video/etoro-negative-balance-protection-most-you-can-lose/">negative balance protection</a>, which I&#x27;ll go into in the next video. We&#x27;ll also cover something called a margin call. Which is when you&#x27;re, let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s been a gap down and you&#x27;ve lost a load of money, a ton of money, more than your <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>, more than the actual value of that trade. You took the trade out for $100, you&#x27;ve lost $500, okay?</p>
        <p>Now let&#x27;s say at the same time you have other trades open in your account. Now a margin call means that eToro will actually close those other open trades that you have to cover the losses of the trade which gap down. That can also happen. I&#x27;ll go into that and the <a href="../../video/etoro-negative-balance-protection-most-you-can-lose/">negative balance protection</a> in the next video.</p>
        <p>Hope that helps. All right, take care. Don&#x27;t use too much leverage, especially if you&#x27;re new. Second month I was trading on eToro, I lost 38% using too much leverage.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s a massive risk. It catches out a lot of people. It can be useful. A lot of people use leverage successfully, but statistically, most new traders do lose money and leverage does seem to be a major contributing factor to that.</p>
        <p>So leverage combined with gaps down in the market can cause some real problems. So it&#x27;s kind of good to be aware of how they can happen. All right, that&#x27;s it. See you next time.</p>
        <p>Bye. Bye.</p>
