        <h2 id="getting-started-on-etoro">Getting Started on eToro</h2>
        <p>Hey everyone, so the thing about eToro, looking at the design here, is just how clean and crisp everything looks. Investing can be frightening, and I think what eToro has really excelled at is making it as simple as possible for us new people. So this is the homepage right here, the first page we see, right there I can see my portfolio value. Our portfolio is just all of the assets we currently have in eToro.</p>
        <p>So once we have some assets in eToro, we&#x27;ll see our portfolio value at a glance. Since 1am, I&#x27;m up $3.83, and it shows a graph of my value of my portfolio over time. Obviously, that&#x27;s the goal. The goal is to track our money, to track our investments, hopefully we&#x27;re doing well.</p>
        <p>So it puts it front and centre, and I can see how have I done over a week, I&#x27;m up $8.75 over a month, over three months. Now we can get much more detailed information, but just as a beginning start homepage, it&#x27;s a good place to track the overall value of our assets. Okay, so up top here, we&#x27;ve got some real stock market looking stuff. We might have seen this in films, or in shows about Wall Street, or brokers, or banks, or whatever.</p>
        <p>This is just ticker symbols. So these are random assets, and over here, each one of these is called a ticker symbol. It&#x27;s a unique code which identifies that asset. Anything that&#x27;s in red, it&#x27;s down that much to date.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s showing the price change to date. So it&#x27;s down 1.34% today, and the UK 100 is up 0.12% today. As you trade more, as you invest more, you&#x27;ll learn more about the ticker symbols, because you&#x27;ll be after different assets. We don&#x27;t all trade the same thing.</p>
        <h2 id="understanding-copy-trading">Understanding Copy Trading</h2>
        <p>Some of us will be into Forex, some will be into crypto, some will be into companies, some will be into gold and silver. Depends where you sort of land in your investment preferences. You&#x27;ll get used to the ticker symbols, but it&#x27;s cool to see. It makes it look really legit, you know, it&#x27;s very interesting to see.</p>
        <p>Down here, we can just see some of the social aspects. I can write, you know, I can write a post, what&#x27;s on my mind, and talk to other people, and sort of hopefully get information from them. I can see what other people are writing, maybe ask questions, and sort of learn about investing through the social aspect. Here, over here, we&#x27;ve got big movers.</p>
        <p>Look how well Meta&#x27;s done. Facebook, 23.28% today. They beat their earnings, apparently, so they did very well. Amazon&#x27;s up, Google&#x27;s up.</p>
        <p>Over here, if I click, boom, anything in red is down in value. So green, up in value, red, down in value. And that&#x27;s the same as up here. These ones, anything red is down in value today, anything green is up in value.</p>
        <p>This homepage is just designed to look beautiful, and give us a very clean way to navigate what can otherwise be a bit of a complicated landscape. They&#x27;ve made it simple, and very attractive. Over here, we&#x27;ve got our watch list. We&#x27;ll look at these big four menu items here.</p>
        <h2 id="fees-you-need-to-know-about">Fees You Need to Know About</h2>
        <p>So my watch lists, I&#x27;m going to invest in different things as I go along in eToro. And the watch lists are a way to keep an eye on stuff. Maybe I want to copy a Forex trader, right. I want to copy a new Forex trader.</p>
        <p>I can create a new watch list. I can simply go to new list, create new list, design a new watch list called Forex copy traders to copy. And then I can browse through the different profiles of different Forex traders on the site. I look at the stats, I can look at different information about them.</p>
        <p>And if I like the look of a Forex trader, I can just add them to my new Forex traders to copy watch list. And then I can go to that watch list, and I can check on them. Maybe I can check on them over a week, or over a month. And I can just check up and see, is this someone I really want to copy.</p>
        <p>Now, I can do this with any different type of asset, and I can create many watch lists. Maybe I want to keep a watch list of different companies I&#x27;m looking to invest in. Or maybe I want to keep a watch list about different commodities, which I think might make big moves in the current economic climate. Watch lists are a very useful way to start sorting potential investments, keep an eye on them, and hopefully make the right decision and invest wisely after a certain amount of time.</p>
        <p>Next one down here is the portfolio. Now, the portfolio, it&#x27;s one of those terms that you hear around investing. And I think it can be very intimidating when you hear it. Yeah, so you know what I&#x27;m talking about.</p>
        <h2 id="the-virtual-practice-account">The Virtual Practice Account</h2>
        <p>There are a lot of benjamins being made right now with the biotech stuff. Yeah, I don&#x27;t have to tell you that. How&#x27;s your portfolio? It often catches people off guard, and we don&#x27;t quite know how to answer this.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;d say strong, to quite strong. Yeah, yeah. You got to strike while the iron&#x27;s hot. Now&#x27;s the time.</p>
        <p>Bring the mail nurse. But actually, a portfolio is a really simple way to just keep track of all of our investments on eToro. Whether it&#x27;s crypto trades, or whether it&#x27;s Forex trades, or commodities, or investing in companies, or copying people, they&#x27;re all going to appear in our portfolio. It&#x27;s a central place to track and amend our investments.</p>
        <p>See, from the portfolio view, I can also close trades. I can reduce the amount I&#x27;ve got invested in a company, or I can add more to open trades, or add more to people I&#x27;m currently copying. There&#x27;s a lot we can do from the portfolio view, and we&#x27;ll go over all of these in their own separate videos to really explore the functionality and what we can do. The portfolio is a really wonderful, central, and simply designed space to keep track of all our investments.</p>
        <p>So, the last one here is Discover. Now, Discover, we&#x27;re going to be investing in very different things on eToro. You might be investing in this type of asset, and I might be investing in another one. There&#x27;s loads to choose from.</p>
        <h2 id="tom-s-top-tips-for-beginners">Tom&#x27;s Top Tips for Beginners</h2>
        <p>So, let&#x27;s go up here and just look at the stocks page. Now, the stocks, there&#x27;s so many constantly being added to eToro. There&#x27;s a really wide variety we can look at. We can organise them differently by software, durable goods, tech, retail, financial services.</p>
        <p>Maybe that&#x27;s... we&#x27;re looking at categories. Or, we can look at their exchanges. Each asset has a different home exchange. Which sort of country are we interested in?</p>
        <p>There&#x27;s loads of ways to sort through this, and we&#x27;ll go through this in fine detail in another video. But, just to show you the amount that there are in here, it&#x27;s incredible. Up here, a whole other section is cryptos. Maybe we&#x27;re interested in investing in cryptos.</p>
        <p>There&#x27;s loads of them on eToro. Indices, over here, another asset class. And really, you&#x27;re going to have to see, during the life of your investing sort of life, what types of assets you&#x27;re interested in. They all have different properties and characteristics, different ways of moving, and different returns, and different styles of trading associated with them.</p>
        <p>Here, we can see commodities, currencies, ETFs, NFTs. And also, if we go back to the overview, we can see, really, what brought me to eToro. If we go down, we can see CopyTrader. We can click View All, and the CopyTrader page has its own menus.</p>
        <p>We can sort and filter them. Where are they from? What markets do they invest in? How much have they gained?</p>
        <p>There&#x27;s so many different people we can potentially copy. And we can start to filter them, and sort through them, and hopefully find the right people for us to copy, so we can make wise investments. So, we&#x27;ll go over the CopyTrading system in its own video, because there&#x27;s so much to unpack. We&#x27;ll unpack all of these different aspects, and parts of the sites.</p>
        <p>Because over time, as we get more used to it, it really does become simpler and simpler. And then we can make decisions which aren&#x27;t just based on panic. We can take our time, hopefully make good decisions, and hopefully make some profit. I&#x27;ll see you in the next one.</p>
