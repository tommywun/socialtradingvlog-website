        <h2 id="the-mistake-most-beginners-make">The Mistake Most Beginners Make</h2>
        <p>Hey everybody, so growing up might impressing of trading and investing was almost a very tale world of money. In the 80s growing up when I did, people with red braces, people with big phones, people with white Ferrari, it was just money and success wall to wall. And things haven&#x27;t really changed over the years, all the films that I&#x27;ve seen, all the characters that I&#x27;ve seen, have all been about this opulent, make money fast and lots of it lifestyle. Even the big short which was about the financial crisis was actually about people making a whole bunch of money.</p>
        <p>So when we come to sites like this retail trading platforms, retail investors at the unfilian entry train, me and you, we didn&#x27;t come up in investment banking, we didn&#x27;t study economics, we just want to come with our money and sort of see if we can get a piece of that dream. Can we put our money to work and be part of this strange elusive world we&#x27;ve all heard about. Now the average person uploads around a thousand to two thousand dollars into their E-tora account. That&#x27;s how much we put aside for this project, how much will we willing to sort of risk, how much can we spare to have a go at this.</p>
        <p>So what&#x27;s the first thing we do when we get to the site? We start looking for people to copy or investsments to make, maybe we haven&#x27;t traded before, maybe we have usually we haven&#x27;t, right? Usually we&#x27;ve got really no experience with this. And most of us are losing money.</p>
        <p>Most retail investors are losing money, we want to look at why that is. Now remember, we&#x27;ve spent a life associating investing with a lot of money with high returns. So how much will we willing to be sort of happy with at the end of our first year? Let&#x27;s say we&#x27;ve invested a thousand dollars.</p>
        <p>What will we be happy with at the end of the year? $50? Unlikely. $500. Maybe. Alright, still not a lot of money after we&#x27;re $500, we can&#x27;t really do much with it.</p>
        <h2 id="why-it-s-so-easy-to-fall-into">Why It&#x27;s So Easy to Fall Into</h2>
        <p>But it&#x27;s a good return, so $500. Do you know how much risk you have to take to make $500 or $1,000? That&#x27;s 50% return. The most of us coming into sites like Utah are exactly what we&#x27;re doing.</p>
        <p>So we often hear about these huge investors like Warren Buffett. People who are just really rich, they&#x27;re all over the news. The Oracle of Omaha everyone seeks out their opinion about investing. They&#x27;re just known as these incredible investors.</p>
        <p>So let&#x27;s say we hear that Warren Buffett makes $50 million. And everyone thinks this guy&#x27;s an absolute genius. But Warren Buffett&#x27;s not really taking a lot of risk to make that $50 million. Let&#x27;s say invest a billion dollars.</p>
        <p>The only has to make 5% 5% in a year. And that&#x27;s in he&#x27;s got his $50 million. And we all think he&#x27;s an absolute genius. See Warren Buffett knows that the most important thing is preservation of capital.</p>
        <p>The last thing these guys are going to do is risk all of their money. Going after these big wins in ways which are going to sort of risk their whole portfolio. They can blow all of their money. We come into E.T.</p>
        <h2 id="what-happens-to-your-account">What Happens to Your Account</h2>
        <p>We&#x27;ve uploaded a say our $1,000. We make 5% what are we getting? $50. In a year, what are you joking? I could go most someone&#x27;s law to make $50.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;m not going to wait a whole year for $50 and somehow be excited. And there&#x27;s some mistake we make. What we do is we start intonating what I want to make $500. That&#x27;s 50% return.</p>
        <p>Warren Buffett&#x27;s not going after a 50% return. The higher return you&#x27;re looking for in terms of percentages, the higher risk you&#x27;re taking automatically. Everyone wants to make like really high returns with very low risk that it just doesn&#x27;t exist. So this preservation of capital should be for us to the first thing we want to do is guard our money.</p>
        <p>That&#x27;s what&#x27;s going to make us more money. But we come along with our $1,000 and we think no, hold on a minute. I don&#x27;t want to make $50. I want to make $500.</p>
        <p>So instantly we start using too much leverage, which is the way to amplify our trade sizes. So if we&#x27;ve got a thousand dollars, I use ten times leverage. So I come trading with ten thousand dollars. The thing about this is that our money can go up real quick and it can go down really quick too.</p>
        <h2 id="the-right-approach-instead">The Right Approach Instead</h2>
        <p>The testically goes down, we make bad, bad moves because there&#x27;s too many emotions. It&#x27;s terrifying when you start seeing losses too quickly in the beginning. We lose money statistically. We blow our accounts going after really excessive gains.</p>
        <p>So what should we be doing? What would you be thinking? What to say for a turn? What to say for a turn for me?</p>
        <p>How much can I realistically expect in terms of percentages? Not in terms of money. Don&#x27;t think in terms of money. Think in terms of a percentage.</p>
        <p>So we&#x27;re always looking how much risk are we taking for our money? When we knew we won $500 from a thousand, we won a 50% return. And it&#x27;s just not realistic. It&#x27;s not what Warren Buffett&#x27;s doing.</p>
        <p>He may be making $50 million, but because he&#x27;s got so much to invest. We don&#x27;t have much to invest. So if we&#x27;ve got a thousand dollars, what can we realistically expect to make? Let&#x27;s say we expect to make 10% in a year.</p>
        <h2 id="tom-s-advice">Tom&#x27;s Advice</h2>
        <p>We&#x27;re not going to take too much risk to take 10%. That&#x27;s $100. Okay, so we&#x27;re going to have to rely. We&#x27;re going to have to rely on something called compounding.</p>
        <p>Okay, realistically. We can do two things. We can either invest more money. So we can instead of having a thousand dollars, we can put it in a hundred thousand dollars.</p>
        <p>Or we&#x27;re going to have to start copying people who are super risky. Johnny Big Potatoes, who&#x27;s made a 143% in the last three month, is most likely going to blow his account. And you copying him, going to blow all your money. So you can try, we do that, try and copy high risk traders.</p>
        <p>Or we start taking out loads of leverage in which case we statistically lose. Or we can reduce our expectations and realize that this is going to take a long time. For me to sort of invest, if I start with a thousand two thousand dollars, it might take ten twenty years. This is a long time horizon.</p>
        <p>This isn&#x27;t something where I&#x27;m going to be clicking and doing stuff and watching what&#x27;s happening daily. It&#x27;s going to be something where I work. I have a normal job. I have a steady income and this is just on the side.</p>
        <p>Hopefully accumulating interest over the years. If we go to someone like Celeste, let&#x27;s look at Celeste over here and we&#x27;ll look at his statistics. We can see that he started off 8.86 on the first year. So you&#x27;ll have made your initial investment.</p>
        <p>You&#x27;ll have made 8% return. That then becomes your principal, the amount of money you&#x27;ve now got to invest. The next year you&#x27;ll have made 28.89% on all of your original investment, plus the 8.86%. So on the third year, now you&#x27;ve got all of these gains plus the original amount that you&#x27;ve invested.</p>
        <p>You&#x27;ve made 12% on all of those gains and all the gains you made before. Do you see how it compounds every year? The gains you made in the last year are carried forward and now we&#x27;re using all of that in our trades. So if we make 12% we make 12% on the entire amount.</p>
        <p>The amount we originally invested plus all the gains that were made in the years before. That&#x27;s compounding of gains. Over the years it&#x27;s not simply 8 then 28 then 12 then 22 because it compounds. It ends up that we&#x27;re making 22% of all of this money that we made before.</p>
        <p>So compounding over time can work and it&#x27;s all over instance. Automatically when we copy people, I&#x27;m copying Sellech. So any trades that they make, any profits that I make in that copy, automatically get proud in for compounding. It&#x27;s meant to build wealth.</p>
        <p>Many have come into investing, including me. And we want things to happen. We want the excitement that we saw in those TV shows about investing. We want something which is really clicking that little dopamine hitting us.</p>
        <p>And sort of giving that as addictive little fix. It&#x27;s not like that. It&#x27;s actually quite boring. It&#x27;s passive.</p>
        <p>It takes a lot of time. Now many of us come in and because we want that little adrenaline here, we start trading in ways which are looking for more risk. We start taking out more leverage like I did. Look at my results first four months.</p>
        <p>That&#x27;s me taking out leverage. Trying to get that hits from investing that I really expected. Nosing 40%. The next year I only made money because I was gambling and lucky.</p>
        <p>The next year after that I was down after that. You can see my results really stabilized because I just started <a href="../../copy-trading.html">copy trading</a>. I was losing potentially far too much money. And that&#x27;s not what I wanted to do.</p>
        <p>I wanted to learn how to do this in some ways sustainably. Another thing I want to do is have a normal job. Have a source of income. Make videos or go and do what you do for work.</p>
        <p>The last thing you want to do is for some emergency to come up in life. So that you can&#x27;t break down or the roof leaking or the dog needs to go to the vet or something. And you have to dip into this to get emergency funds. Don&#x27;t over extend yourself.</p>
        <p>Don&#x27;t invest more than you can afford to leave for a very long time and still maintain life with all the emergencies which might come up. Because otherwise you&#x27;re going to have to dip into this. What are you going to be doing? You&#x27;re not going to be closing trades at the optimum time.</p>
        <p>You&#x27;re going to be probably closing them when you really shouldn&#x27;t be closing them. It&#x27;s a terrible idea and a lot of people make that mistake. Because we&#x27;re getting lower returns and we want more money invested to make them quicker. This almost has to be a machine.</p>
        <p>Make sure we have the funds available in the real world so we can leave this here doing its job over time. It takes time from everything I&#x27;ve seen. All the ways I&#x27;ve tried to short cut that and make money quickly have ended in me losing money. It&#x27;s happened in this.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s happened in my desire to make money quickly in cryptos, in NFTs. Everything I&#x27;ve done to make money fast has ended up losing me money. So what&#x27;s sustainable is investing in people like him. I think although that again this is not investment advice.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;ve only just started copying him. Or you look at someone like Izabee you again. I&#x27;ve just started copying. Look at a stats.</p>
        <p>They&#x27;re really 9.4% 16% Small amounts within the year at compounds. 0.55, 0.56, 0.79. But over the year, bump that ends in 9% even though the small percentages. Same thing happens year on year you see. So compounding is a huge thing.</p>
        <p>So I&#x27;m trying to take a bar in a job. I&#x27;ll stop talking now. I hope it goes really well for you. And you&#x27;re managing to not come in here like most of us and just lose our money.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s an exciting thing that it takes time. That&#x27;s it. See you in the next one. Thank you.</p>
