        <h2 id="what-is-the-etoro-virtual-account">What Is the eToro Virtual Account?</h2>
        <p>Okay, so, when you sign up to eToro, when you make a public profile, one thing they give you, eToro always gives everyone, is something called a Virtual Portfolio. Okay, so, you don&#x27;t know what a portfolio is. Portfolio is like the name given to all of the things you&#x27;re trading. It&#x27;s like a big book, but it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s on the actual website, and it sort of lists all of the things that you&#x27;re currently trading, whether it&#x27;s stocks or shares or commodities or forex or whatever, you&#x27;ll be able to find them in your portfolio.</p>
        <p>So, the Virtual Portfolio is like a normal portfolio, it means you can use the site, learn how to use the buttons, learn how to use everything about it, all of its features, but you&#x27;re not risking real money. What they do is they give you like $100,000 of fake money, basically. It&#x27;s just numbers in a database, but it looks the same as if you&#x27;re trading with a real thing. So, if you look at here, my portfolio, these are things I have in my portfolio at the moment, and down here, you can see I&#x27;ve got $84.96 available, $1,282 equity, this sort of shows the money which is tied up, which is not.</p>
        <p>If I go here, here says Real, do you see that? If I just click that button, I can go to my Virtual Portfolio. Switch to Virtual Portfolio, you&#x27;re about to switch to your Virtual Portfolio, here you can practice your trading skills without any risk of loss. I mean, that&#x27;s really what&#x27;s important.</p>
        <p>They give you a Virtual Portfolio, really it&#x27;s a marketing tool for them. What they&#x27;re doing is saying, here, have a look at our system, learn to use it, learn to trade, learn to open trades, close trades, see what sort of things you can trade, learn to copy people, and you can do it all with this fake money. We&#x27;ll give you $100,000 of fake money, here, practice and use it. And what they&#x27;re banking on is that their system&#x27;s kind of really so good, that if you use it for a while, you&#x27;ll think, alright, I&#x27;m ready to have a go, and you&#x27;ll upload real money, and then that&#x27;s good for them as well.</p>
        <p>So that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re doing with Virtual Portfolio. So, everyone can get one, it&#x27;s non-binding. So when they give you a Virtual Portfolio, you could trade with a Virtual Portfolio for, you know, years. It doesn&#x27;t mean you ever have to upload any money, or, you know, anything.</p>
        <h2 id="how-to-switch-to-the-virtual-account">How to Switch to the Virtual Account</h2>
        <p>It&#x27;s not a binding thing, having a Virtual Portfolio. So I click that, and then I go to my Virtual Portfolio, and in here, you can see I have an available balance of, which is really... I have an available balance of $94,000. $94,000, total allocated that much. I&#x27;ve been using this Virtual Portfolio for about, I don&#x27;t know, well, since I started really, and so these have been going on for quite a while, but look, there&#x27;s a lot of money in there.</p>
        <p>None of this money is real, it&#x27;s all virtual money, which means it&#x27;s just, you know, entries in a database. If I make profit here, which I have, I&#x27;ve made $1,000 profit in my Virtual Portfolio. Do I have $1,000? No.</p>
        <p>Can I withdraw that money? No. But, if that said, I&#x27;ve made $10,000 loss, would I owe them money? No, it&#x27;s not real money.</p>
        <p>Everything that happens in the Virtual Portfolio, it&#x27;s just virtual. If I make a million profit, I don&#x27;t have a cent. If I lose a million, I don&#x27;t owe anyone a cent. It&#x27;s not real.</p>
        <p>Very useful, because it lets you use their system, and work out the buttons, and what all this stuff on the left means, you know, how do I trade markets, and how do I copy people and stuff, without having the risk involved, and that&#x27;s really useful, you know. I think one of the things coming into trading, is that it&#x27;s terrifying. I remember, you know, it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve always known about, you know, trading and stock markets and stuff, but it was always, sort of, it was just high ... oh my god, that&#x27;s a bit scary. I&#x27;d see people in the braces, and with the phones, and you know, I grew up in the 80s, and I&#x27;d have this image of people who really knew what they were doing.</p>
        <h2 id="copying-traders-with-virtual-money">Copying Traders with Virtual Money</h2>
        <p>It&#x27;s obviously not me, and also, it&#x27;s all about maths, and it&#x27;s all about numbers, and you have to understand the markets. It can be a very daunting thing, a very frightening thing. So what they&#x27;ve tried to do here, is to give people an introduction to it. They&#x27;ve made a website which is so easy, so simple, and kind of user-friendly, that they&#x27;re banking on the fact that you&#x27;ll use it, and go, alright, I understand a bit about what&#x27;s going on now, and I&#x27;m ready to, sort of, try and invest my own money.</p>
        <p>So, some things which are different. Always make sure, by the way, I&#x27;m going to do some videos after this, about, you know, how to start a new trade, and you know, how to trade this and that. Just, if you, when you&#x27;re in your virtual portfolio, always make sure when you log on, if you want to use the virtual portfolio, that this is ticked on virtual. Okay, so I can go back to real, by clicking that, go back to real portfolio.</p>
        <p>Simple. Now I&#x27;m in the real one, I&#x27;m trading with my real money. Okay, you always, you can always have two. My virtual portfolio didn&#x27;t disappear when I actually put money in.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s just, I have to switch between the two, you see, using this little button here. In future, when you&#x27;re watching this video, that may have changed. The way of getting there may have changed. I can&#x27;t speak for that, but the principles are still going to be the same.</p>
        <p>So, I go back to my virtual portfolio here. One thing, when you&#x27;re trading, especially when you&#x27;re <a href="../../copy-trading.html">copy trading</a>, you often look at people&#x27;s statistics. So, if you go onto a person&#x27;s page, copy people, let&#x27;s say I choose here, MrThor7734, and I can see on his feed, or his stats page, here is statistics, you see. These statistics show, you know, how much did he make in 2016, in 2017, month by month, yeah, and it shows his average risk score, how many copiers he&#x27;s got, how many trades he&#x27;s got, what percentage is profitable out of all of those trades, what sort of things he trades, stocks, commodities, cryptos.</p>
        <h2 id="the-limitations-of-the-virtual-account">The Limitations of the Virtual Account</h2>
        <p>There&#x27;s a lot of stuff on the statistics page for each trader, you know, frequently traded things, how often he holds trades, how many times he trades per week, blah, blah, blah. A lot of stuff in statistics. Now, your statistics on your profile page are formed from your real trading account, where you&#x27;re actually trading with your own money. They&#x27;re not formed from your virtual portfolio.</p>
        <p>So that&#x27;s quite useful, because in your virtual portfolio, you can lose a million, and you can, you know, whatever, you can practice, you can make mistakes, you can... Some of the buttons can be a bit fiddly, if you don&#x27;t know what they are, you know. When you, sort of, for instance, I go to my portfolio, and let&#x27;s have a look at a trade. Tesla, alright, so here&#x27;s an old Tesla trade I did.</p>
        <p>If I press that, I might think I&#x27;ll get rid of it, I might press it by accident, and it will close the trade, and oh no, I didn&#x27;t mean to... So, you have to get used to these buttons, you have to get used to them, and whilst you&#x27;re getting used to them, you might make a few mistakes, and those mistakes would then show up in your statistics. But, if you&#x27;re in your virtual portfolio, no matter what you do, it&#x27;s not going to show up in your statistics, they&#x27;re completely hidden. The only statistics people will ever see about you, is what you do with your real money.</p>
        <p>So hopefully, you&#x27;ve kind of practiced enough in the virtual portfolio, to actually not make so many mistakes when you go into it. When I first started with eToro, I did use the virtual portfolio, but not long enough. I thought, no, I&#x27;m clever, I can probably trade myself, I&#x27;m going to have a go at this, and proceeded to lose, you know, here, if you look at it, my... There, here, boom, 38%.</p>
        <p>I lost 38% in the second month that I was trading, because literally, I just thought, well, I can probably have a go at this, I&#x27;m pretty smart, and I didn&#x27;t use the virtual portfolio enough, and I think it would be useful. I mean, all the stuff&#x27;s available in the virtual portfolio, so if I go to trade markets, and I go to stocks, and I choose, let&#x27;s go to Apple, because everyone knows that one, Apple, you know, all the stuff&#x27;s still available. I can still see information about Apple, I can still read more about it, and find out about the company in the stats page. I can go to the charts, and get familiar with how these charts work, and I mean, most of it is just getting familiar with how stocks move, and how things move, you&#x27;ll see the patterns and things.</p>
        <h2 id="when-to-switch-to-real-money">When to Switch to Real Money</h2>
        <p>So, I can, you know, zoom in and zoom out, and I can maximise it, I can change the timeframe. I can set it up how I want, do I want it in bars, do I want it in candles, do I want it in lines, do I... So, you can get used to this sort of stuff in the virtual portfolio, without any risk, and that&#x27;s very useful. You can have a look at the research thing, and find out about that.</p>
        <p>There&#x27;s various things you can do in the virtual portfolio, so I think some of the next videos I&#x27;ll make are about things that I would recommend you do in a virtual portfolio, before trying to do them in the real life. Just so that... Because my experience is, you have to get used to the buttons, you have to get used to how it works. So, open a trade, close a trade, set a trade with 5x leverage, set a trade with 2x leverage.</p>
        <p>Open a copy, learn how to copy someone, copy people, learn how you actually do that. How you research people to copy, how you find one. When you find a copy person, what does this mean? What&#x27;s a copy <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>?</p>
        <p>Once you have copied someone, where do they appear in your portfolio, you know? How do you add funds to them, add funds? How do you remove funds from that copy? How do you pause it?</p>
        <p>Things like that. There&#x27;s a few things which I&#x27;d say, and I&#x27;ll make videos about what would I try and learn in the virtual portfolio, and just get used to doing physically, before trading with real money. Again though, you could run a virtual portfolio for years, and never have to pay eToro a thing. That&#x27;s quite great.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s a very useful learning tool, and it&#x27;s also because it&#x27;s tied into the real, live markets. All the markets are real, all the systems are real, everything is real. All the assets you&#x27;re trading are real. You&#x27;re just doing it with virtual money.</p>
        <p>Fantastic.</p>

      <h3 class="faq-q">Is the eToro virtual account realistic?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">Yes and no. Prices and platform features are identical to the real account. However, virtual trading removes the psychological pressure of real money — which is actually one of the biggest factors in real trading performance. Use it to learn mechanics, but know that real trading will feel different.</p>
