        <h2 id="how-leverage-works-on-etoro">How Leverage Works on eToro</h2>
        <p>Hey everybody, so yesterday in the video, I talked about some of the risks associated with using leverage, and why it&#x27;s kind of warned against, especially for new traders, and how it can, you know, lead to loss of money. So, if you haven&#x27;t seen yesterday&#x27;s video, here it is, up in the top left corner, it might give you some context to what I&#x27;m talking about today, which is some of the fees associated with using leverage. So here are those 3 that I opened yesterday in my virtual portfolio. 3 Amazon trades, okay, on all of them, I&#x27;ve used $500, okay, so it&#x27;s the same amount of money, same amount of my equity, the money I have, that I&#x27;ve used on each trade, $500. But the units are different.</p>
        <p>So this one is x1 leverage. Now x1 leverage is like using no leverage, okay, you have to use x1, x2, x3, whatever. x1, this is no leverage, so I&#x27;ve got 0.28 units of Amazon stock. This one, I&#x27;ve used x2 leverage, so I&#x27;ve got 0.56 units, it&#x27;s double the units. Same amount of money, double the units, because I&#x27;ve used x2 leverage.</p>
        <p>Here, I&#x27;ve used x5 leverage, same amount of money, I&#x27;ve got many more units now, 5 times the units here, because I used x5 leverage. So, it&#x27;s amplified the amount of units that I&#x27;ve bought, even though I&#x27;ve used the same amount of money. It&#x27;s why it&#x27;s attractive to new people, new people generally don&#x27;t have a lot of money to trade with. So, the average account size, I think it&#x27;s 2,000, statistically, on average, that is put into a new trader&#x27;s account.</p>
        <p>So, they&#x27;re more likely to use leverage, which is a bit silly, because, you know, they&#x27;re more likely to also get in trouble whilst using leverage, which they&#x27;d lower the minimum trade size. Anyhow, over here, we can see that the one with no leverage on it, just says buy Amazon, and the other two, x2 and x5 leverage, both say CFD, okay, so what&#x27;s CFD? So, a CFD, whenever you use leverage on eToro, or you open a sell position, and by sell, I don&#x27;t mean you close the trade, different thing, so a sell position, a buy position means you&#x27;re buying it, and you&#x27;re betting the value will go up, and you want to make money as it goes up, and then you close the trade, and you take your profit. A sell position means you want to, you&#x27;re betting the value is going to go down, and you want to make money as it goes down, okay, and you take your profit then, you close the trade.</p>
        <p>There&#x27;s a video about what short selling is, here, you can watch that, but both of these here, you open a CFD, whenever it&#x27;s a buy position, which is leveraged, or a sell position of any sort, even if you&#x27;re not using leverage, it&#x27;ll be a CFD. CFD is a contract for difference, alright, so here I&#x27;ve bought Amazon, I&#x27;ve bought the actual stock of Amazon, so theoretically, if I buy enough Amazon, it&#x27;s like I own part of the actual company. Theoretically, if I buy enough of it, I can walk into the boardroom one day, there&#x27;s Jeff Bezos, and say, hey, listen here Jeff, it&#x27;s my company now, and I can, you know, I can take control of that company, I literally own part of Amazon. With a CFD, I don&#x27;t own any actual Amazon stock whatsoever.</p>
        <h2 id="the-fees-attached-to-leverage">The Fees Attached to Leverage</h2>
        <p>I&#x27;ve bought a thing, a contract for difference, which is directly tied to the value of Amazon. So as Amazon goes up, my CFD goes up in value. If Amazon goes down, my CFD goes down in value. If I buy it here, and it goes up, and I close the trade, I take the profit, exactly as if I owned the underlying asset, but I don&#x27;t, I own a CFD of it.</p>
        <p>If the value of Amazon goes down, I lose money, exactly as if I owned Amazon. CFD, okay, and it&#x27;s part of how they make money when we&#x27;re using leverage. So, why is that important? Alright, firstly, on all of these trades, I have to pay <a href="../../video/etoro-spread-fees-explained/">spread fees</a>, okay.</p>
        <p>So the <a href="../../video/etoro-spread-fees-explained/">spread fee</a> is a small amount of money. I&#x27;ve made another set of videos about fees, all the fees. You can watch that, and it goes into more detail about what these are, but a spread fee is basically every trade you do, whether it&#x27;s leveraged or non-leveraged, buy or sell on eToro. It&#x27;s one of the principal ways they make their money, they charge a little bit of money on each trade.</p>
        <p>So, all of your trades will open slightly at a loss. That&#x27;s because the <a href="../../video/etoro-spread-fees-explained/">spread fee</a> is being applied, and eToro needs to make that money back first. You need to make that money, and then once you&#x27;re in the green, the rest of the money is yours. So, that first bit of money is always the spread fee that goes to eToro.</p>
        <p>Now, they calculate the <a href="../../video/etoro-spread-fees-explained/">spread fee</a> based on the amount of units you&#x27;ve bought, okay. So as we can see here, with the non-leveraged trade, I&#x27;ve got 0.28 units. The more leverage I use, the more it gives me power to buy more units. The more units I have, the higher my spread fees will be, okay.</p>
        <h2 id="overnight-fees-on-leveraged-positions">Overnight Fees on Leveraged Positions</h2>
        <p>So on the leveraged trade, on the x2, I will have paid double the <a href="../../video/etoro-spread-fees-explained/">spread fees</a> I did here on the one with no leverage. Here on the x5 trade, I will have paid 5 times the spread fees that I did there, because I own more units, you know. My profit... I can make profit faster, I can make loss faster, but also, because I have more units, more spread fees, okay.</p>
        <p>Even if I bought 1.41 with no leverage, I&#x27;d have to pay the same <a href="../../video/etoro-spread-fees-explained/">spread fees</a> as I do here, alright. So, the leverage isn&#x27;t actually making the spread fees more expensive. Leverage just means I have more units, so my spread fees will be higher, okay. So those are the first ones, my spread fees will be higher because of the units.</p>
        <p>Now that&#x27;s true of leveraged and non-leveraged trades, always getting charged <a href="../../video/etoro-spread-fees-explained/">spread fees</a>. If you want to find out what the spread fees are, you go here, you can go to the help section and you can type market hours and fees. Big page here, commodities, cryptos, there&#x27;s different spreads and different fees on all instruments that have broken it up. I go to stocks because Amazon&#x27;s a stock, so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m looking, and with the addition of share dealing on eToro, all spreads for stocks have been unified, the fees are as far as...</p>
        <p>It used to be that on different types of stocks, Amazon or Facebook or Google or NVIDIA, there&#x27;d be different <a href="../../video/etoro-spread-fees-explained/">spread fees</a>, and now they&#x27;ve unified it all, so it&#x27;s 0.09% spread per side. Spread per side means that it&#x27;s 0.09% when you open the trade, and you get charged 0.09% of the units you bought when you close the trade. So, per side means when you open and close, it&#x27;s going to be 0.09% each time, alright. So, there&#x27;s no management fees on eToro, there&#x27;s no ticket fees.</p>
        <p>Management fees used to mean that, you know, you&#x27;d have to pay someone to look after your money, a broker or a money manager, and we don&#x27;t have that on eToro, and even when we&#x27;re copying someone, we don&#x27;t actually pay them, you know, for the privilege of copying them, which is great. No <a href="../../video/etoro-rollover-overnight-fees/">rollover fees</a>, that&#x27;s the other type of fee we&#x27;re going to talk about. That&#x27;s only for non-leveraged, when you&#x27;re not using leverage, and when it&#x27;s a buy trade, you don&#x27;t get charged rollover fees. So for any time you&#x27;re using leverage, or if you&#x27;re opening a short selling trade, you&#x27;re always going to get charged rollover fees.</p>
        <h2 id="a-real-world-cost-example">A Real-World Cost Example</h2>
        <p>So for leveraged positions, we get these as well. So that&#x27;s what spreads are. Those are the, one of the primary things, if I go back to my portfolio, on all three of these trades, non-leveraged and leveraged will have been paid, will have been charged <a href="../../video/etoro-spread-fees-explained/">spread fees</a>, okay. All trades on eToro.</p>
        <p>The other type of fee, here, these ones are CFDs, we&#x27;re obviously using leverage. Where does that money come from? What is that? How can we, sort of, open a trade with times two leverage?</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s like we&#x27;re borrowing money. How did I get more units for the same money? How did I get more units for the same money, here, five times the amount of units? So, whenever you use leverage, what you&#x27;re basically doing is, you&#x27;re borrowing money to buy more units.</p>
        <p>Who are you borrowing money off? In this case, really, it&#x27;s eToro. We&#x27;re, sort of, borrowing money off eToro, to pay for our bigger trade size. So, on other exchanges, in the past, you&#x27;d literally...</p>
        <p>You&#x27;d borrow money, you&#x27;d buy more units, and you&#x27;d pay interest on that money that you borrowed. Same as if you borrow money for a bank, you know, they&#x27;re not just going to give it to you out of the goodness of their heart. They want something in return. So, they&#x27;d lend you money, you&#x27;d be trading with it, but they want interest on that money they&#x27;ve lent you.</p>
        <h2 id="is-leverage-worth-it-for-beginners">Is Leverage Worth It for Beginners?</h2>
        <p>Now, the way that they get it back on eToro, is by another type of fee. We don&#x27;t pay them interest on the money that we borrow, but we, sort of, do, because we pay back these overnight and weekend fees. That&#x27;s the charge that they charge us for having used the leverage, okay, it&#x27;s all included in that. So, if we go back to this help page here, we see Unified Spreads, and then we see Stocks <a href="../../video/etoro-rollover-overnight-fees/">Overnight Fees</a>.</p>
        <p>So, CFD trades for leveraged and short positions only. So, anytime you open a short position, you&#x27;re going to get these fees as well, and every time we open a leveraged position, we&#x27;re going to get these fees. What they are, is there&#x27;s <a href="../../video/etoro-rollover-overnight-fees/">overnight fees</a>, and weekend fees. It&#x27;s a little amount of money which they charge us, and it depends on the amount of units we&#x27;ve bought.</p>
        <p>Again, it&#x27;s a ratio of the units we&#x27;ve bought, and every time, if I open a trade today, and I close it tomorrow, that means I&#x27;m going to have held it overnight, one night. There&#x27;s a tiny fee on that for the overnight, and that happens every day you hold it, they will keep charging that until you close it, and then you won&#x27;t get any more of those fees. But as long as you have the trade open, so I open it here, and there&#x27;s 1, 2, 3 days, I&#x27;ll get 3 of these <a href="../../video/etoro-rollover-overnight-fees/">overnight fees</a>. On the weekend, they charge you for 2 days, or I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the weekend, it&#x27;s actually Friday, Saturday and Sunday, so it&#x27;s 3 days and 4 overnights, or if it&#x27;s 5 daily fees and 2, and the weekend includes 2 days, I&#x27;m not quite sure, but there&#x27;s the overnight fees, and the weekend fee, which is just for holding it over the weekend.</p>
        <p>So you&#x27;ll get charged them, as long as you keep the trade open, and that is basically how Etoro charges you money for using leverage, or short positions, okay. So here we can see how it&#x27;s worked out, 6.4% plus 1 month of the LIBOR. LIBOR is like the London Interbank, I can&#x27;t remember what it stands for, but it&#x27;s a globally used lending rate, alright, so they&#x27;re just calculating on that. There we are, LIBOR is the benchmark rate most international banks use when giving short term loans, okay.</p>
        <p>So here&#x27;s an example of how you can work that out. So, these fees will apply, these overnight and weekend fees, it seems hard to understand how to calculate that. There&#x27;s a simpler way. When we open a trade here, let&#x27;s go to Facebook, boom, go to Facebook, Facebook page, when we go to trade, I&#x27;m still in my virtual portfolio, so let&#x27;s put in 500 like we did yesterday.</p>
        <p>Alright, so if I&#x27;m doing x1, it says I&#x27;m buying the underlying asset, I&#x27;m actually buying Facebook stock, and that&#x27;s all you see, although I&#x27;m going to put it to full screen so it&#x27;s easy to see. So we&#x27;re buying, here&#x27;s Facebook, that&#x27;s all we see. This is the information, <a href="../../video/etoro-copy-trading-stop-loss-risk/">stop loss</a>, <a href="../../video/etoro-take-profit-can-i-change-it/">take profit</a> and the leverage, buying the underlying asset, and underneath open trade, it says this, by buying the stock, you accept our securities addendum, alright. Watch what happens over here, when I press x2.</p>
        <p>Second I press x2, so I&#x27;m using leverage now, x2 leverage, it shows me the daily <a href="../../video/etoro-rollover-overnight-fees/">overnight fee</a> and the weekend fee that are going to be charged on my trade, alright. So we have now, instead of x1, we have 3.5 units, and exposure is $500, 0.4% for 2% of my equity, which is $500 is in my <a href="../../video/etoro-virtual-practice-account/">virtual account</a>, 0.42% of all the money I can trade with, it&#x27;s my equity. So you have 3.151 units, 0.42% of my equity, my exposure is 500, and there&#x27;s nothing down here, no overnight or weekend fees, no leverage. x2, I&#x27;ve suddenly got double the units, it&#x27;s the same amount of my equity that I&#x27;m using, but my exposure has also doubled. How much risk have I got? $1000, it&#x27;s showing me what it&#x27;s like, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m trading with $1000, and down here we have the daily fee that I&#x27;m going to be charged every day that I keep this trade open, and the weekend fee.</p>
        <p>So every weekend that I have this open, I&#x27;ll be charged that as well. x5, watch this go up, boom, x5, it&#x27;s gone up. Daily I&#x27;m now going to be charged 59 cents, and on the weekend, I&#x27;m going to be charged 177. I now have 17.35 units, watch it change, boom, boom, 17.53 units, because it amplifies the units I&#x27;ve bought, still the same amount of my overall money that I&#x27;m actually spending on the trade, but my exposure is like $2,500, because it&#x27;s my $500 x 5, so like, my risk is like I&#x27;m trading with $2,500. So there we are, these weekend fees and daily fees, every time I use leverage on anything, it will show me how much that&#x27;s going to be, and it will calculate there, at the bottom, what they&#x27;re going to be.</p>
        <p>So it&#x27;s an easy way to see how much extra you&#x27;re actually going to be paying. So I&#x27;m going to stop that one there, and in the next one, I&#x27;m going to talk about how that will affect different people&#x27;s trading styles, and can I lose more money than I actually put in by using leverage. Are there any other risks to it? So there we are, for this video, every one of these trades, I will have been charged <a href="../../video/etoro-spread-fees-explained/">spread fees</a>, leveraged or not leveraged.</p>
        <p>On the leveraged ones, I will also have been charged those daily fees, those <a href="../../video/etoro-rollover-overnight-fees/">overnight fees</a>, and those weekend fees. It&#x27;s the privilege, it&#x27;s the way I pay back eToro, for actually lending me the money in the leverage. Lending me the money, so I can buy more units, using the same amount of cash. They have to get their money back somehow.</p>
        <p>Anyhow, alright, see you next time.</p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">What fees does eToro charge for using leverage?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">Using leverage on eToro means your position is a CFD, which incurs overnight fees for every night you hold it open. There are no upfront fees for using leverage itself, but the overnight charges accumulate quickly on large or long-held leveraged positions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Does leverage cost money on eToro?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">Indirectly, yes. Leverage doesn&#x27;t carry an upfront cost, but leveraged positions on eToro are CFDs that incur nightly rollover fees. The higher your leverage and the longer you hold the position, the more you pay. Weekend fees are also triple the normal nightly rate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Should beginners use leverage on eToro?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">Most experienced traders would advise beginners to avoid leverage entirely until they have a solid understanding of how it works. Leverage amplifies both gains and losses, and the associated overnight fees can make profitable trades unprofitable if held too long.</p>
