        <h2 id="before-you-close">Before You Close: Things to Consider</h2>

        <p>Before you go through the closure process, it&#x27;s worth taking a step back and asking yourself: do you actually need to <em>close</em> the account, or do you just need a break?</p>

        <p>I&#x27;ve seen people close their accounts in frustration &#x2014; maybe after a bad run of copy trading results, or because they got hit with a fee they didn&#x27;t expect &#x2014; and then regret it later when they wanted to come back. Once your account is closed, you can&#x27;t just reopen it. You&#x27;d have to start from scratch with a new account, go through the whole verification process again, and lose your entire trading history.</p>

        <p>Here are a few things to consider before you go ahead:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Are you frustrated with a specific trade or loss?</strong> That&#x27;s normal. It happens to everyone. Take a break, withdraw some money if you need to, but don&#x27;t burn the whole thing down in the heat of the moment.</li>
          <li><strong>Are the fees bothering you?</strong> Check out my <a href="../etoro-fees/">full breakdown of eToro fees</a> &#x2014; you might find the costs are more manageable than you think, especially if you&#x27;re not actively trading.</li>
          <li><strong>Do you just want your money back?</strong> You can withdraw all your funds without closing the account. That way you keep the option to come back later.</li>
          <li><strong>Worried about the inactivity fee?</strong> eToro charges $10/month after 12 months of no logins &#x2014; but all you have to do is log in once a year to avoid it. That&#x27;s it. No trading required.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If after all that you still want to close your account, fair enough. Let&#x27;s do it properly.</p>

        <h2 id="withdraw-funds">How to Withdraw All Your Funds First</h2>

        <p>This is the most important step, and you need to do it <em>before</em> you request account closure. Here&#x27;s the process:</p>

        <p><strong>1. Close all open positions.</strong> Go to your Portfolio and close every open trade &#x2014; stocks, ETFs, crypto, copy trading, everything. You want a completely flat portfolio with no open positions. If you&#x27;re copying traders, stop copying them first, which will close all copied positions.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Wait for settlement.</strong> After closing positions, there can be a short settlement period &#x2014; especially for stock trades. This is usually 1&#x2013;2 business days. Your cash balance might not reflect the full amount immediately, so give it a day or two before you try to withdraw.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Withdraw everything.</strong> Go to the withdrawal section and withdraw your full available balance. If you&#x27;re on a USD account, remember there&#x27;s a <a href="../etoro-withdrawal-fees/">$5 withdrawal fee</a> and a $30 minimum. If you have a local currency account (GBP, EUR, AUD, DKK), withdrawals are free with no minimum.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Wait for the withdrawal to process.</strong> Withdrawals typically take 1&#x2013;3 business days to hit your bank account or e-wallet. Don&#x27;t request account closure until you&#x27;ve confirmed the money has arrived.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">A common mistake: people try to close their account while they still have funds in it. This complicates things and can delay the process. Get your money out first, confirm it&#x27;s in your bank, then proceed with closure.</p>

        <h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step: How to Close Your eToro Account</h2>

        <p>Once your balance is at zero (or close to it) and all positions are closed, here&#x27;s how to request account closure:</p>

        <p><strong>1. Log in to eToro</strong> on the web platform (desktop is usually easier for this than the app).</p>

        <p><strong>2. Go to Settings.</strong> Click your profile icon or name, then select &#x27;Settings&#x27; from the dropdown menu.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Navigate to the Account tab.</strong> Within Settings, look for the &#x27;Account&#x27; section.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Find the closure option.</strong> Scroll to the bottom of the Account page. You should see a link or option to &#x27;Close Account&#x27; or &#x27;Deactivate Account.&#x27; Click it and follow the prompts.</p>

        <p><strong>5. Confirm your request.</strong> eToro will likely ask you to confirm the closure and may ask for a reason. Be honest &#x2014; it doesn&#x27;t affect the outcome, but it might help them improve things for other users.</p>

        <p><strong>If you can&#x27;t find the closure option:</strong> This happens sometimes &#x2014; the interface changes, or the option isn&#x27;t visible in certain regions or account types. If that&#x27;s the case, email eToro support directly at <strong>support@etoro.com</strong> and request account closure. Include your username and registered email address. They&#x27;re required to process it.</p>

        <p>You can also open a support ticket through the eToro Help Centre. Either way, put it in writing so you have a record of the request.</p>

        <h2 id="open-positions">What Happens to Open Positions When You Close?</h2>

        <p>If for some reason you request account closure while you still have open positions, eToro will auto-close them at the current market price. This is not ideal &#x2014; and here&#x27;s why.</p>

        <p>You have zero control over the exit price. If the market is down when they close your positions, you&#x27;re locking in those losses. If it&#x27;s a weekend or outside market hours, CFD positions might close at the next available price, which could gap against you.</p>

        <p>This is exactly why I recommend closing everything yourself, manually, before you start the closure process. You choose the timing. You choose the price. Don&#x27;t leave it to an automated process.</p>

        <p>The same applies to copy trading &#x2014; if you&#x27;re still copying someone when the account closes, all those copied positions get liquidated at market price too. Stop copying first, let the positions close, then proceed.</p>

        <h2 id="download-history">How to Download Your Trading History and Tax Data</h2>

        <p>This is one that a lot of people forget, and it can come back to bite you. <strong>Before you close your account, download your trading history.</strong> Once the account is gone, you may lose access to this data &#x2014; and you&#x27;ll need it for tax purposes.</p>

        <p>Here&#x27;s how to get it:</p>

        <p><strong>1. Go to your Portfolio</strong> and click on the clock icon or &#x27;History&#x27; tab to see your past trades.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Generate an Account Statement.</strong> Go to Settings &gt; Account &gt; Account Statement. You can choose the date range &#x2014; I&#x27;d recommend selecting the full lifetime of your account to capture everything.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Download the PDF.</strong> The statement includes all trades, deposits, withdrawals, fees, dividends, and profit/loss for each position. This is the document you (or your accountant) will need at tax time.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Save it somewhere safe.</strong> Don&#x27;t just download it and forget about it. Save it to cloud storage, email it to yourself, or put it on an external drive. You may need to refer to it years from now.</p>

        <p>If you&#x27;re a UK taxpayer, your eToro account statement is essential for calculating Capital Gains Tax. I&#x27;ve written more about this in my <a href="../etoro-tax-uk/">eToro UK tax guide</a>. Even if you&#x27;re not in the UK, most countries require you to report investment gains and losses &#x2014; so keep that statement.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">Seriously, do this before anything else. I&#x27;ve heard from people who closed their accounts and then realised they had no records for their tax return. Don&#x27;t be that person.</p>

        <h2 id="how-long">How Long Does Account Closure Take?</h2>

        <p>Once all your funds have been withdrawn and you&#x27;ve submitted the closure request, the actual account closure typically takes a few business days. eToro needs to process the request, verify there are no outstanding balances or pending transactions, and then deactivate the account.</p>

        <p>Here&#x27;s a rough timeline for the whole process:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Closing positions:</strong> Instant (during market hours)</li>
          <li><strong>Settlement:</strong> 1&#x2013;2 business days</li>
          <li><strong>Withdrawal processing:</strong> 1&#x2013;3 business days</li>
          <li><strong>Account closure after request:</strong> A few business days</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So from start to finish, expect it to take roughly a week, sometimes a bit longer if there are complications or if you need to go through email support.</p>

        <p>You should receive a confirmation email when the account has been officially closed. If you don&#x27;t hear back within a reasonable time (say, 10 business days), follow up with support.</p>

        <h2 id="reopen">Can You Reopen a Closed eToro Account?</h2>

        <p>The short answer: generally, no.</p>

        <p>Once your eToro account has been fully closed, it&#x27;s gone. You can&#x27;t reactivate it, you can&#x27;t recover your old trading history on the platform, and you can&#x27;t pick up where you left off. If you want to use eToro again, you&#x27;d need to create a brand new account &#x2014; new username, new verification, starting from zero.</p>

        <p>This is one of the biggest reasons I tell people to really think about it before closing. If there&#x27;s even a small chance you might want to come back, it&#x27;s better to just withdraw your funds and leave the account open. An empty account with no open positions costs you nothing &#x2014; as long as you log in once every 12 months to avoid the inactivity fee.</p>

        <p>Some people have reported being able to contact eToro support to reactivate a recently closed account, but this is not guaranteed and seems to depend on timing and circumstances. Don&#x27;t count on it.</p>

        <h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives to Closing</h2>

        <p>If you&#x27;ve read this far and you&#x27;re having second thoughts, here are some alternatives that might give you what you actually need without the permanence of full account closure:</p>

        <p><strong>1. Withdraw your funds and go dormant.</strong> Close all your positions, withdraw your cash, and just leave the account sitting there. It costs nothing to maintain an empty eToro account as long as you log in once a year. This is my top recommendation for people who think they <em>might</em> come back.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Avoid the inactivity fee with one login per year.</strong> The $10/month inactivity fee only kicks in after 12 consecutive months with zero logins. Set yourself a calendar reminder to log in once a year &#x2014; it takes 30 seconds and saves you the fee. Even if your balance is zero, it&#x27;s good practice to keep the account accessible just in case. For more on this fee, see my <a href="../etoro-fees/">eToro fees breakdown</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Reduce your activity instead of stopping entirely.</strong> Maybe you don&#x27;t need to go cold turkey. You could stop copy trading, close your riskier positions, and just hold a few long-term investments. Lower your exposure instead of cutting it to zero.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Switch to the virtual portfolio.</strong> If you want to stay engaged without risking real money, eToro&#x27;s virtual portfolio lets you practise with $100,000 in virtual funds. You keep your account active, you avoid inactivity fees, and you can test strategies without putting capital at risk.</p>

        <p>The bottom line: closing is permanent. Withdrawing is not. If you&#x27;re not 100% sure, withdraw and wait.</p>
