          <strong>Risk Warning</strong>
          eToro is a multi-asset investment platform. The value of your investments may go up or down. 51% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with eToro. You should consider whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money. This content is for educational and informational purposes only — it is not investment advice.

        </div>

        <h2 id="what-passive-means">What &#x27;Passive&#x27; Actually Means</h2>
        <p>True passive income means you set something up once and it generates money indefinitely without any ongoing effort. A rental property with a management company. Dividend-paying stocks you never touch. A book that earns royalties years after you wrote it.</p>
        <p>Copy trading doesn&#x27;t quite clear that bar. But it&#x27;s closer to passive than most investment approaches — especially compared to active trading, where you&#x27;re glued to charts all day.</p>
        <p>The honest framing is: copy trading is a semi-passive activity. The day-to-day execution is automated. The research, selection, and occasional monitoring are not.</p>
        <h2 id="what-it-automates">What Copy Trading Automates</h2>
        <p>When you set up a copy trade on eToro, the actual buying and selling of assets is completely automated. When your copied trader opens a position, your account mirrors it proportionally — instantly, automatically, without you doing anything.</p>
        <p>You don&#x27;t need to watch the markets. You don&#x27;t need to time entries and exits. You don&#x27;t need to decide which stocks to buy. The entire trading process is handled by the trader you&#x27;ve chosen to copy.</p>
        <p>This is genuinely useful. The cognitive load of active trading — constantly monitoring prices, second-guessing decisions, fighting emotional impulses — is removed. That&#x27;s a real benefit, especially for people who don&#x27;t have the time or inclination to manage a portfolio actively.</p>
        <h2 id="what-you-still-do">What You Still Have to Do</h2>
        <p>The research phase is not automated. Finding traders worth copying takes real time and effort. Reading their statistics, understanding their strategy, checking their drawdown history, comparing multiple candidates — this is work that you have to do yourself.</p>
        <p>Monitoring is also your responsibility. Copy trading is not a set-it-and-forget-it system. You need to check in periodically — maybe once a month — to make sure your copied traders are still performing as expected. Risk scores can change, traders can change strategy, or they can simply stop performing.</p>
        <p>When you need to switch traders — because one stops performing, or you&#x27;ve found someone better — that&#x27;s a decision you have to make. Closing a copy, evaluating the positions, deciding what to keep or sell — that&#x27;s active work, even if it only happens a few times a year.</p>
        <p>Tax administration is also on you. You need to report your investment gains, access eToro&#x27;s annual statements, and understand the tax treatment of dividends, crypto gains, and capital gains in your country.</p>
        <h2 id="realistic-returns">Realistic Return Expectations</h2>
        <p>What can you actually expect to earn? With good trader selection, realistic long-term returns from copy trading are in the 8–20% per year range. Some years will be better, some worse — a bad market year might mean flat or slightly negative performance.</p>
        <p>That compares well to a global index fund, which returns roughly 7–10% per year on average. The best copy traders can outperform that; the worst will underperform it significantly.</p>
        <p>The returns are NOT 50% per month, as some social media content would have you believe. Anyone promising that is either lying or taking enormous risks that will eventually catch up with them.</p>
        <p>The honest projection: on a £10,000 investment with good trader selection, reasonable years might produce £1,000–£2,000 in gains. That&#x27;s £80–£170 per month — meaningful, but not life-changing on its own. Scale up the investment amount and the results scale proportionally.</p>
        <p class="toms-note">These are rough estimates based on my own experience — not financial projections. Everyone&#x27;s results will be different depending on which traders you copy, when you invest, and what markets do. I&#x27;m not a financial adviser and I genuinely can&#x27;t tell you what your returns will be. Please don&#x27;t put money in that you can&#x27;t afford to lose.</p>
        <h2 id="verdict">Tom&#x27;s Honest Verdict</h2>
        <p>Copy trading is about as passive as investing gets without just buying index funds. The automation is genuine and useful. The research and monitoring requirements are real but manageable — a few hours to set up, a few hours per year to maintain.</p>
        <p>For someone who wants to put their money to work without becoming an active trader, copy trading is worth considering. It&#x27;s more engaging than an ISA or index fund, and potentially more rewarding — but it also requires more oversight.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;ve been copy trading on eToro since 2017. I&#x27;d describe it as passive investing with a research requirement attached. Not fully passive, but a lot more hands-off than trading yourself.</p>
        <p class="toms-note">None of this is financial advice — I want to be upfront about that. I&#x27;m just sharing what my experience has been like. I came to eToro because I wanted to invest without being a trader, and that&#x27;s still basically where I&#x27;m at. I&#x27;ve learned a lot along the way, but I&#x27;m still very much a regular person figuring it out.</p>
