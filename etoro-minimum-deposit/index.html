        <p class="article-intro">One of the most common questions I get asked is "how much money do you actually need to start on eToro?" I've been using the platform since 2016 &mdash; nearly 10 years now &mdash; and the answer has changed quite a bit over that time. The official minimum deposit depends on where you live, but the <em>practical</em> minimum &mdash; the amount that actually lets you do something useful &mdash; is a different story entirely. This guide breaks it all down based on my own experience, not just what eToro's marketing page says.</p>

          <strong>Risk Warning</strong>
          eToro is a multi-asset investment platform. The value of your investments may go up or down. 51% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with eToro. You should consider whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money. This content is for educational and informational purposes only &mdash; it is not investment advice.

        <h2 id="minimum-deposit-2026">What Is eToro's Minimum Deposit in 2026?</h2>

        <p>Let's start with the straightforward answer. The eToro minimum deposit varies by country. Here's the current breakdown:</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Region / Country</th>
              <th>Minimum First Deposit</th>
              <th>Minimum Subsequent Deposits</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>United States</td>
              <td>$50</td>
              <td>$50</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>United Kingdom</td>
              <td>$100</td>
              <td>$50</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Austria, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland</td>
              <td>$50</td>
              <td>$50</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Other EU countries &amp; Australia</td>
              <td>$50&ndash;$100</td>
              <td>$50</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Rest of the world</td>
              <td>$200</td>
              <td>$50</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>A couple of things to note here. All deposits on eToro are denominated in USD (unless you have a local currency account). So if you're in the UK depositing in GBP, you'll need the GBP equivalent of $100 at the current exchange rate &mdash; plus a small currency conversion fee, which I'll cover below.</p>

        <p>Also, the first deposit minimum is often higher than subsequent deposits. Once you've made that initial deposit, topping up later is usually $50 minimum regardless of where you live.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">I'm based in the EU these days. My first deposit back in 2016 was $200 &mdash; that was the minimum for everyone at the time. The fact that it's now as low as $50 in some countries is a genuine improvement.</p>

        <h2 id="deposit-history">How eToro's Minimum Deposit Has Changed Over the Years</h2>

        <p>When I first signed up for eToro in 2016, the minimum deposit was $200 across the board. It didn't matter where you lived &mdash; everyone had to put in at least $200 to get started. For some regions it was even higher.</p>

        <p>Over the years, eToro has steadily lowered the barrier. The UK minimum dropped to $100, the US came down to $50, and various European countries followed. The trend has been downward, which makes sense &mdash; eToro wants new users, and a lower entry point reduces friction.</p>

        <p>But here's what I've noticed: the minimum going down doesn't mean you <em>should</em> start with the minimum. Starting with $50 on eToro in 2026 gives you a pretty limited experience. Meanwhile, the minimum for copy trading has stayed fixed at $200 per trader for as long as I can remember &mdash; and that has a big impact on what you can actually do with a small account.</p>

        <h2 id="practical-minimum">Minimum Deposit vs. Practical Minimum &mdash; What I Recommend After 10 Years</h2>

        <p>This is where I want to be genuinely honest, because this is the section most "eToro minimum deposit" articles skip over.</p>

        <p>Yes, you <em>can</em> deposit $50 in some countries. But should you? After nearly 10 years on the platform, here's what I've found:</p>

        <p><strong>$50 is technically enough to open an account</strong> &mdash; but you can't copy trade, can't build a diversified portfolio, and you'll feel limited almost immediately.</p>

        <p><strong>$200 lets you copy one trader</strong> &mdash; but if that trader has a rough month, your entire eToro experience is shaped by one person's performance.</p>

        <p><strong>$500&ndash;$1,000 is what I'd actually recommend.</strong> You can copy 2&ndash;5 traders, hold some individual stocks or ETFs on the side, and have enough breathing room that a bad week doesn't kill your motivation.</p>

        <p>I'm not saying throw in a thousand dollars on day one. But if <a href="../copy-trading.html">copy trading</a> is your goal &mdash; which is the main reason most people come to eToro &mdash; plan to build up to at least $500 fairly quickly. Deposit $200 now, add more next month. That's exactly what I did.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">The people I see quit eToro the fastest are the ones who deposited the absolute minimum, felt like they couldn't do anything, and left disappointed. Either commit to building your account over a few months, or wait until you have enough to use the platform properly.</p>

        <h2 id="copy-trading-minimum">Minimum Deposit for Copy Trading (It's Different)</h2>

        <p>If you're coming to eToro for <a href="../copy-trading.html">copy trading</a> &mdash; the platform's biggest draw &mdash; then the minimum deposit conversation changes.</p>

        <p>The minimum to copy a single trader is <strong>$200</strong>. That's per trader, not total. Three traders? $600. Five? $1,000.</p>

        <p>Why does this matter? Diversification. I've written about <a href="../how-many-traders-to-copy-etoro/">how many traders you should copy</a> and <a href="../how-to-choose-copy-traders-etoro/">how to choose them</a>. Copying just one person is risky &mdash; they could have a terrible month, change strategy, or stop trading. Spreading across 3&ndash;5 traders gives you a much more stable experience.</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Your Deposit</th>
              <th>Number of Traders You Can Copy</th>
              <th>My Take</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>$200</td>
              <td>1 trader</td>
              <td>Very limited &mdash; all eggs in one basket</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>$400</td>
              <td>2 traders</td>
              <td>Slightly better, but still concentrated</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>$600</td>
              <td>3 traders</td>
              <td>Starting to make sense &mdash; some diversification</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>$1,000</td>
              <td>5 traders</td>
              <td>My recommended starting point for copy trading</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>$2,000+</td>
              <td>5&ndash;10 traders</td>
              <td>Well diversified &mdash; room to experiment</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>You can also combine copy trading with manual investing. For example, deposit $500, allocate $400 to copy two traders ($200 each), and use the remaining $100 to buy individual stocks or ETFs you like. That's a reasonable way to start if you're not ready to go all-in on copy trading.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that copy trading on eToro doesn't carry its own fee &mdash; there's no management fee or performance fee. The costs are just the underlying trading fees, which are the same as if you'd placed the trades yourself. I've covered all of this in my <a href="../etoro-fees/">eToro fees guide</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="payment-method">Minimum Deposit by Payment Method</h2>

        <p>The minimum deposit can also vary depending on how you fund your account. eToro accepts quite a few payment methods, but not all of them have the same minimums or processing times.</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Payment Method</th>
              <th>Minimum Deposit</th>
              <th>Processing Time</th>
              <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Credit / Debit Card</td>
              <td>$50&ndash;$200 (varies by region)</td>
              <td>Instant</td>
              <td>Most popular option. Visa and Mastercard accepted.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Bank Transfer</td>
              <td>$500 (most regions)</td>
              <td>3&ndash;7 business days</td>
              <td>Higher minimum but no payment processor fees. Good for larger deposits.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>PayPal</td>
              <td>$50&ndash;$200 (varies by region)</td>
              <td>Instant</td>
              <td>Not available in all countries.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Skrill / Neteller</td>
              <td>$50&ndash;$200 (varies by region)</td>
              <td>Instant</td>
              <td>E-wallet option. Available in select regions.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Apple Pay / Google Pay</td>
              <td>$50&ndash;$200 (varies by region)</td>
              <td>Instant</td>
              <td>Newer option. Convenient for mobile users.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>The big one to watch out for is <strong>bank transfer</strong> &mdash; in most regions the minimum is $500, significantly higher than card deposits. Bank transfers also take several business days to process. If you're depositing the minimum, a card or e-wallet is the way to go. For larger deposits, bank transfer avoids any potential card fees from your bank's side.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">I've used both over the years. Debit card for my first deposit &mdash; instant and simple. Nowadays I use bank transfer for larger top-ups because I'm in no rush and it's cleaner for tax purposes.</p>

        <h2 id="conversion-fees">Currency Conversion Fees on Your First Deposit</h2>

        <p>This catches a lot of new users off guard. If you're depositing in any currency other than USD &mdash; GBP, EUR, AUD, anything &mdash; eToro charges a currency conversion fee of approximately <strong>0.5% (50 pips)</strong>. On a $1,000 deposit that's about $5. Not huge, but it applies to every deposit and withdrawal unless you have a local currency account.</p>

        <p>Here's what that looks like in practice:</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Deposit Amount (USD equivalent)</th>
              <th>Approximate Conversion Fee (0.5%)</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>$50</td>
              <td>~$0.25</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>$200</td>
              <td>~$1.00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>$500</td>
              <td>~$2.50</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>$1,000</td>
              <td>~$5.00</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>$5,000</td>
              <td>~$25.00</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>There are a few ways to reduce or avoid this fee:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Local currency account:</strong> eToro offers GBP, EUR, AUD and DKK accounts through eToro Money. If you deposit and trade in the same currency, there's no conversion fee. This is particularly useful for UK users who primarily trade UK stocks.</li>
          <li><strong>eToro Club tiers:</strong> Higher Club tiers get discounts on conversion fees. Platinum and Platinum+ members get 50% off, and Diamond members pay no conversion fees at all. I've covered this in more detail in my <a href="../etoro-fees/">eToro fees breakdown</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Deposit in USD:</strong> If your bank or payment provider allows you to send USD directly (some UK banks like Wise make this easy), you can skip the conversion entirely.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="toms-note">When I first started on eToro in 2016, I didn't even think about conversion fees. I just deposited GBP and didn't realise I was paying a spread on every deposit. Over 10 years, that adds up. It's one of those things I wish someone had told me upfront &mdash; so I'm telling you now.</p>

        <h2 id="what-can-you-do">What Can You Actually Do With $50 / $200 / $500 / $1,000?</h2>

        <p>The minimum deposit number on its own doesn't tell you much. What matters is what you can actually <em>do</em> once that money hits your account.</p>

        <h3>With $50</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Buy fractional shares of 1&ndash;3 stocks or ETFs (minimum trade is $10 for stocks)</li>
          <li>Get a feel for the platform, explore the interface, set up your watchlist</li>
          <li>You <strong>cannot</strong> copy trade ($200 minimum per trader)</li>
          <li>You <strong>cannot</strong> invest in Smart Portfolios ($500 minimum)</li>
          <li>Very limited diversification &mdash; essentially a test drive</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>My verdict:</strong> Fine for testing the waters. Don't expect to learn much about copy trading or build a real portfolio.</p>

        <h3>With $200</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Copy <strong>one</strong> trader (the minimum allocation)</li>
          <li>Or buy fractional shares of 10&ndash;20 stocks/ETFs</li>
          <li>Still can't invest in Smart Portfolios ($500 minimum)</li>
          <li>One bad pick has an outsized impact on your account</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>My verdict:</strong> Where most beginners start on a budget. You can learn the mechanics of copy trading, but with only one trader copied, you're not getting the full picture. Think of it as a stepping stone.</p>

        <h3>With $500</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Copy 2 traders ($200 each) and hold $100 in individual stocks/ETFs</li>
          <li>Or invest $500 in a single Smart Portfolio</li>
          <li>Or build a small manual portfolio of 15&ndash;25 positions</li>
          <li>Enough to start understanding how different strategies play out</li>
          <li>Some breathing room for currency conversion fees and market fluctuations</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>My verdict:</strong> The sweet spot for beginners. You can genuinely use eToro's core features &mdash; copy trading, individual investing, maybe a Smart Portfolio. This is where I tell friends and family to aim for.</p>

        <h3>With $1,000</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Copy 3&ndash;5 traders with a proper diversification strategy</li>
          <li>Hold a Smart Portfolio plus individual stocks/ETFs on the side</li>
          <li>Enough to compare different <a href="../etoro-risk-score-explained/">risk score levels</a> across your copied traders</li>
          <li>Room to adjust allocations without constantly hitting minimums</li>
          <li>A realistic starting point for treating eToro as an actual investment account</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>My verdict:</strong> My recommended starting point for serious copy trading. You can build a diversified portfolio, learn from multiple strategies, and have enough capital that the platform's features actually make sense. For what realistic returns look like, see <a href="../copy-trading-returns.html">how much you can make copy trading</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="how-to-deposit">How to Make Your First Deposit</h2>

        <p>I've done this more times than I can count over the past decade. Here's the current step-by-step:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Create your account.</strong> Sign up on eToro's website with an email address, or use Google/Facebook.</li>
          <li><strong>Verify your identity.</strong> Upload a passport or driving licence plus proof of address (utility bill or bank statement). Usually takes a few hours, sometimes up to 2 days. You can explore the virtual portfolio ($100K practice money) while you wait.</li>
          <li><strong>Click "Deposit Funds".</strong> It's at the bottom on mobile, or in the left sidebar on desktop.</li>
          <li><strong>Choose your amount and payment method.</strong> Enter at least the minimum for your country and select card, bank transfer, PayPal, etc. Non-USD deposits will show the conversion rate before you confirm.</li>
          <li><strong>Confirm and wait.</strong> Card and e-wallet deposits are instant. Bank transfers take 3&ndash;7 business days. Once funds arrive, you're ready to go.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="toms-note">One thing that trips people up: you need to be fully verified before depositing real money. I've had people message me saying "I can't deposit" &mdash; 99% of the time, verification isn't complete yet. Upload clear photos and it usually goes through quickly.</p>

        <p>After your first deposit, don't rush into trades. Spend time browsing the <a href="../copy-trading.html">copy trading</a> section, understanding <a href="../etoro-risk-score-explained/">risk scores</a>, checking the <a href="../etoro-fees/">fee structure</a>, and maybe testing a strategy with the virtual portfolio first. Your money will sit safely in your account until you invest it &mdash; that's better than making impulsive decisions on day one. Trust me, I've made that mistake myself in the early days.</p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">What is the minimum deposit for eToro in 2026?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">The eToro minimum deposit varies by country. In the US it's $50, in the UK it's $100 (paid in GBP equivalent), in most of Europe and Australia it's $50&ndash;$100, and for the rest of the world it's typically $200. These minimums apply to first deposits &mdash; subsequent deposits may have lower minimums depending on your region.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Can I start eToro with $50?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">Yes, if you're in the US or certain European countries. However, $50 is very limiting in practice. You can buy fractional shares of a few stocks or ETFs, but you won't be able to copy trade (which requires $200 per trader) or build a diversified portfolio. I'd recommend starting with at least $500 if you want to actually use eToro's features meaningfully.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">How much money do I need to copy trade on eToro?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">The minimum to copy a single trader on eToro is $200. To build a properly diversified copy trading portfolio of 3&ndash;5 traders, you'd realistically need $600&ndash;$1,000. I recommend $1,000 as a practical starting point for copy trading based on nearly 10 years of experience.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Does eToro charge fees on deposits?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">eToro doesn't charge a deposit fee itself, but if you deposit in a currency other than USD (such as GBP or EUR), you'll pay a currency conversion fee of approximately 0.5% (50 pips). For example, depositing &pound;1,000 would cost roughly &pound;5 in conversion fees. You can reduce this with an eToro Club membership or by opening a local currency account.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">What is the minimum deposit for eToro in the UK?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">The minimum first deposit for eToro in the UK is $100 (paid in GBP equivalent). Subsequent deposits have a lower minimum of $50. Keep in mind that depositing in GBP will incur a currency conversion fee of around 0.5% since eToro's base currency is USD &mdash; unless you have a GBP local currency account through eToro Money.</p>
