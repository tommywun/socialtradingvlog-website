        <p class="article-intro">&ldquo;Is eToro safe?&rdquo; &mdash; it&rsquo;s one of the most common questions I get, and honestly, it&rsquo;s the right question to ask before you hand over real money to any platform. I&rsquo;ve been using eToro since 2016 &mdash; that&rsquo;s nearly 10 years now &mdash; with real money on the line the entire time. I&rsquo;m based in Malta, I&rsquo;ve deposited, withdrawn, copy traded, and invested through bull markets, bear markets, and a global pandemic. So I&rsquo;m not going to give you a generic &ldquo;yes it&rsquo;s regulated&rdquo; answer. I&rsquo;m going to tell you exactly what I&rsquo;ve experienced, what protections actually exist, and where the real risks are.</p>

          <strong>Risk Warning</strong>
          eToro is a multi-asset investment platform. The value of your investments may go up or down. 51% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with eToro. You should consider whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money. This content is for educational and informational purposes only &mdash; it is not investment advice.

        <h2 id="short-answer">The Short Answer (Is eToro Safe?)</h2>

        <p>Yes. eToro is a legitimate, heavily regulated investment platform. It is not a scam, it is not a fly-by-night operation, and it is not going to disappear with your money overnight. I&rsquo;ve covered this topic in more detail in my <a href="../etoro-scam.html">Is eToro a Scam?</a> article, but the short version is: the platform is real, the regulation is real, and the investor protections are real.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve been using eToro since 2016 with real money. Not a demo account, not a sponsored test &mdash; actual deposits from my own bank account, actual withdrawals back to it. In nearly 10 years, every withdrawal has processed, every position has executed, and my money has always been accessible when I&rsquo;ve needed it.</p>

        <p>But here&rsquo;s the thing people often confuse: the platform being safe is not the same as trading being safe. eToro themselves disclose that 51% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs on their platform. That&rsquo;s not a platform safety issue &mdash; that&rsquo;s a market risk issue. The money isn&rsquo;t being stolen. People are losing it through trades that go against them, leveraged positions that get wiped out, or copy trading strategies that underperform.</p>

        <p>So when I say eToro is safe, I mean: the company is legitimate, your funds are protected by regulation, and the platform works as advertised. Whether you&rsquo;ll make money on it is an entirely different question &mdash; and one that depends on you, not on eToro.</p>

        <h2 id="regulation">eToro&rsquo;s Regulatory Status in 2026 (Country by Country)</h2>

        <p>One of the strongest arguments for eToro&rsquo;s safety is its regulatory footprint. This isn&rsquo;t some offshore broker operating out of a PO box. eToro holds licences from multiple top-tier financial regulators around the world, each with their own strict requirements around client fund protection, capital adequacy, and operational transparency.</p>

              <td>Registered as a money services business with FinCEN. Member of FINRA and SIPC, which provides investor protection.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>As a user based in Malta, my account falls under CySEC regulation (eToro Europe Ltd). That means my account is subject to EU financial regulations, including MiFID II protections, negative balance protection on CFDs, and mandatory client fund segregation.</p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that eToro isn&rsquo;t a small startup. The company has raised over $500 million in funding from major institutional investors. When SoftBank&rsquo;s Vision Fund and other tier-one venture capital firms put hundreds of millions into a company, they&rsquo;ve done their due diligence. That doesn&rsquo;t guarantee anything, of course, but it does tell you this is a serious, well-capitalised financial services company &mdash; not a garage operation.</p>

        <h2 id="bankruptcy">What Happens to Your Money if eToro Goes Bankrupt?</h2>

        <p>This is one of the questions I see come up the most, and it&rsquo;s a perfectly reasonable concern. What if eToro itself goes under? Would your money just vanish?</p>

        <p>The short answer is no, and here&rsquo;s why: <strong>client funds are held in segregated accounts</strong>, separate from eToro&rsquo;s own operational funds. This is a legal requirement under all of eToro&rsquo;s regulatory licences. It means that if eToro were to become insolvent, your money isn&rsquo;t mixed in with the company&rsquo;s money &mdash; it&rsquo;s ring-fenced.</p>

        <p>In practice, if eToro went bankrupt, an administrator would be appointed to return client funds. Because the money is segregated, it can be identified and returned to clients. This process isn&rsquo;t instant &mdash; it could take weeks or months &mdash; but the money is there.</p>

        <p>On top of segregation, there are investor compensation schemes in each jurisdiction that provide an additional layer of protection. These are essentially insurance policies that cover you if, for some reason, the segregated funds aren&rsquo;t sufficient. I&rsquo;ll cover these in detail in the next section.</p>

        <p>Is it likely that eToro will go bankrupt? Based on everything we can see &mdash; over 35 million registered users, $500M+ in institutional funding, a profitable business model &mdash; it doesn&rsquo;t appear to be in any financial distress. But the protections exist precisely for scenarios that nobody expects. That&rsquo;s the whole point.</p>

        <h2 id="compensation">Investor Compensation Schemes That Protect You</h2>

        <p>Beyond fund segregation, each of eToro&rsquo;s regulated entities is covered by a compensation scheme. These are government-backed or industry-funded insurance mechanisms that protect your money if a regulated firm fails and can&rsquo;t return client funds.</p>

        <p><strong>United Kingdom &mdash; FSCS (Financial Services Compensation Scheme)</strong></p>
        <p>If you&rsquo;re using eToro (UK) Ltd and the company fails, the FSCS covers eligible claims up to <strong>&pound;85,000 per person</strong>. This is the same scheme that protects your savings at a UK bank. It&rsquo;s funded by levies on the financial services industry and backed by the UK government. It covers investments held with FCA-regulated firms, so if eToro UK couldn&rsquo;t return your money, the FSCS would step in.</p>

        <p><strong>Europe &mdash; ICF (Investor Compensation Fund)</strong></p>
        <p>For European users like me (regulated under CySEC), the ICF covers eligible claims up to <strong>&euro;20,000 per person</strong>. This is lower than the UK&rsquo;s FSCS, which is worth knowing. The ICF is triggered if a CySEC-licensed firm becomes insolvent and cannot return client assets. It&rsquo;s funded by contributions from CySEC-regulated investment firms.</p>

        <p><strong>United States &mdash; SIPC (Securities Investor Protection Corporation)</strong></p>
        <p>US users are covered by SIPC, which protects up to <strong>$500,000 in securities</strong> (including a $250,000 limit for cash claims). SIPC is a nonprofit membership corporation &mdash; every broker-dealer registered with FINRA is required to be a member. It&rsquo;s specifically designed to protect investors if a brokerage firm fails.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">For what it&rsquo;s worth, I don&rsquo;t keep my entire net worth on eToro. No single platform should hold everything. The compensation limits (&euro;20,000 in Europe) are relatively modest compared to large portfolios. Diversifying across brokers is a sensible risk management step that most people overlook.</p>

        <h2 id="personal-experience">My Personal Experience: Has Anything Gone Wrong in 10 Years?</h2>

        <p>This is probably the section people actually want to read. Forget the regulatory blurb for a moment &mdash; what has it actually been like using eToro with real money for nearly a decade?</p>

        <p><strong>Withdrawals have always worked.</strong> I&rsquo;ve withdrawn money from eToro many times over the years. Every single withdrawal has processed and arrived in my bank account. The usual processing time is 1&ndash;3 business days, though I&rsquo;ve occasionally seen it take a little longer. I&rsquo;ve never had a withdrawal blocked, frozen, or denied. When you see people online claiming they &ldquo;can&rsquo;t withdraw from eToro,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s almost always because they haven&rsquo;t completed their KYC verification or they&rsquo;re trying to withdraw funds that are tied up in open positions.</p>

        <p><strong>Customer support is sometimes slow.</strong> This is probably my biggest gripe. eToro&rsquo;s customer support has improved over the years, but it can still be frustratingly slow, especially during busy periods. If you raise a support ticket, you might wait a few days for a response. For urgent issues, that&rsquo;s not ideal. It&rsquo;s the price you pay for being on a platform with 35 million+ users and a support team that&rsquo;s clearly stretched. It&rsquo;s not a safety concern &mdash; more of an inconvenience.</p>

        <p><strong>Platform outages during extreme volatility.</strong> This has happened a few times, and it&rsquo;s the most serious operational issue I&rsquo;ve experienced. During the GameStop saga in January 2021, eToro (along with many other brokers) experienced significant platform issues. There were periods where you couldn&rsquo;t execute trades, the app was slow or unresponsive, and positions were difficult to manage. It was frustrating and, for anyone with leveraged positions open, genuinely stressful.</p>

        <p>To be fair, eToro wasn&rsquo;t alone in this &mdash; Robinhood, Trading 212, Interactive Brokers, and others all had issues during that period. Extreme market events stress every platform. But it&rsquo;s something you should know about: if there&rsquo;s a massive market event, there&rsquo;s a chance the platform could slow down or become temporarily unavailable.</p>

        <p><strong>My money has always been accessible.</strong> Through all of it &mdash; COVID crash in March 2020, GameStop in 2021, the crypto winter of 2022, the interest rate hikes &mdash; my money has always been there. I&rsquo;ve never woken up to find my balance missing or my account locked for no reason. The platform has always functioned as expected in normal market conditions, which covers about 99% of trading days.</p>

        <p>If you want more context on my overall eToro experience, I&rsquo;ve been documenting it on my <a href="../copy-trading.html">copy trading</a> page and through regular video updates on my YouTube channel.</p>

        <h2 id="security">Security Features (2FA, Account Verification, etc.)</h2>

        <p>eToro takes account security seriously, and the features they offer are in line with what you&rsquo;d expect from any major financial platform in 2026.</p>

        <p><strong>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong> &mdash; You can enable 2FA on your eToro account using an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator or Authy). When enabled, you&rsquo;ll need to enter a one-time code every time you log in, on top of your password. I strongly recommend enabling this. It&rsquo;s the single most effective thing you can do to protect your account from unauthorized access.</p>

        <p><strong>KYC Verification</strong> &mdash; eToro requires full identity verification before you can deposit or withdraw funds. You&rsquo;ll need to provide government-issued ID and proof of address. This is a regulatory requirement (anti-money laundering rules), but it also protects you &mdash; it makes it much harder for someone to fraudulently open an account in your name or access your funds.</p>

        <p><strong>SSL Encryption</strong> &mdash; All data transmitted between your device and eToro&rsquo;s servers is encrypted using industry-standard SSL/TLS protocols. This protects your login credentials, personal information, and financial data from being intercepted.</p>

        <p><strong>Segregated Accounts</strong> &mdash; As I mentioned above, your funds are held in segregated accounts at tier-one banks, separate from eToro&rsquo;s own corporate funds. This is both a regulatory requirement and a critical security measure.</p>

        <p><strong>Login Notifications</strong> &mdash; eToro sends email notifications when your account is accessed from a new device or location. This gives you an early warning if someone gains unauthorized access to your account.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">The most common way people get &ldquo;hacked&rdquo; on any financial platform isn&rsquo;t because the platform&rsquo;s security is weak &mdash; it&rsquo;s because they reuse passwords, fall for phishing emails, or don&rsquo;t enable 2FA. Use a unique password, turn on 2FA, and don&rsquo;t click links in emails claiming to be from eToro. Go directly to the website or app instead.</p>

        <h2 id="track-record">eToro&rsquo;s Track Record: Company History and Funding</h2>

        <p>eToro was founded in 2007 in Tel Aviv, Israel, by brothers Yoni and Ronen Assia along with David Ring. That makes it nearly 20 years old as a company &mdash; which is a lifetime in the fintech world. Most fintech startups don&rsquo;t survive their first five years. eToro has been operating continuously for almost two decades.</p>

        <p>Over that time, the company has grown to <strong>over 35 million registered users</strong> across 100+ countries. It was one of the first platforms to introduce social trading features (the ability to see other traders&rsquo; portfolios and copy their trades), and it remains the largest social trading platform in the world.</p>

        <p>On the funding side, eToro has raised over <strong>$500 million</strong> from institutional investors. Notable backers include SoftBank&rsquo;s Vision Fund, Spark Capital, China Minsheng Financial Holdings, and others. When SoftBank puts $100M+ into a company, they&rsquo;ve done extensive due diligence on its financials, compliance, and business model.</p>

        <p>In 2021, eToro announced plans to go public via a SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) merger, which would have valued the company at around $10 billion. That deal ultimately didn&rsquo;t complete &mdash; the SPAC market cooled significantly in 2022, and many companies pulled their SPAC deals during that period. eToro has remained private since then, though IPO speculation continues to surface periodically.</p>

        <p>The fact that the company is still private rather than publicly listed means there&rsquo;s less financial transparency than you&rsquo;d get from a listed company. We don&rsquo;t have quarterly earnings reports to scrutinise. That said, regulated entities are still required to file accounts with their regulators, and the sheer scale of the operation &mdash; millions of active users, hundreds of employees, offices worldwide &mdash; makes it about as established as a private fintech company can be.</p>

        <h2 id="actual-risks">What Are the Actual Risks of Using eToro?</h2>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve spent most of this article telling you why eToro is safe. Now let me balance that with an honest look at the real risks. Because while the platform itself is legitimate and well-regulated, that doesn&rsquo;t mean using it is risk-free. Far from it.</p>

        <p><strong>1. Trading risk &mdash; most people lose money.</strong> This is the biggest risk, and eToro says it right on their website: 51% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs. If you&rsquo;re using leverage, trading CFDs, or dabbling in forex, there is a very real chance you will lose money. This isn&rsquo;t an eToro problem &mdash; it&rsquo;s a trading problem. Markets are unpredictable, and most retail traders underperform over time. For an honest breakdown of costs, see my <a href="../etoro-fees/">eToro Fees Explained</a> guide.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Spread costs eat into your returns.</strong> eToro makes money primarily through spreads (the difference between the buy and sell price of an asset). On stocks and ETFs, the spread is the natural market spread and pretty tight. On CFDs, crypto, and forex, the spreads are wider and can meaningfully eat into your returns &mdash; especially on smaller positions or frequent trades. These costs are easy to overlook but compound over time.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Platform risk &mdash; outages during extreme volatility.</strong> As I mentioned in my personal experience section, eToro has experienced platform issues during extreme market events. If you&rsquo;re holding leveraged positions and the platform goes down at the worst possible moment, you could be unable to close a losing trade. This is a risk on every retail trading platform, but it&rsquo;s worth understanding.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Copy trading risk &mdash; copied traders can lose money too.</strong> <a href="../copy-trading.html">Copy trading</a> feels safe because you&rsquo;re following someone who (presumably) knows what they&rsquo;re doing. But copied traders are not fund managers with a fiduciary duty to you. They can change their strategy, take on more risk, or simply have a bad year. I&rsquo;ve seen popular traders with great track records go through extended drawdowns. Past performance genuinely is not a guarantee of future results.</p>

        <p><strong>5. Currency conversion costs for non-USD users.</strong> eToro&rsquo;s base currency is USD. If you&rsquo;re depositing in GBP, EUR, or another currency, you&rsquo;ll pay a currency conversion fee on every deposit and potentially on every trade involving a USD-denominated asset. These fees vary by your eToro Club tier but can be meaningful for European users. eToro now offers local currency accounts (GBP, EUR, AUD, DKK) which can help reduce this, but it&rsquo;s still an ongoing cost that many users don&rsquo;t fully account for.</p>

        <div class="risk-warning">
          <strong>Important</strong>
          None of these risks mean eToro is unsafe as a platform. They mean that investing and trading carry inherent risks that no amount of regulation can eliminate. The platform can be perfectly legitimate and you can still lose money. Make sure you understand the difference.

        <h2 id="comparison">eToro Safety vs. Other Brokers</h2>

        <p>If you&rsquo;re comparing eToro&rsquo;s safety credentials against other popular brokers, here&rsquo;s how they stack up on the key metrics that actually matter:</p>

        <p>A few things stand out from this comparison. Interactive Brokers is the clear winner on track record and transparency &mdash; they&rsquo;ve been around since 1978 and are publicly listed on NASDAQ, which means full financial transparency through quarterly earnings reports. If maximum safety and institutional-grade infrastructure are your top priorities, IBKR is hard to beat. For a deeper comparison, see my <a href="../etoro-vs-trading-212/">eToro vs Trading 212</a> piece, which covers similar ground.</p>

        <p>eToro, Trading 212, and DEGIRO are all well-regulated and offer the standard investor protections for their respective jurisdictions. The main difference with eToro is that it&rsquo;s still privately held, which means less public financial transparency than a listed company. That said, eToro&rsquo;s sheer user base (35M+) and the scale of institutional investment it&rsquo;s attracted give it a level of validation that smaller private brokers don&rsquo;t have.</p>

        <p>For most retail investors, all four of these platforms are &ldquo;safe enough.&rdquo; The differences in safety are marginal. The real differences are in fees, features, available markets, and user experience &mdash; which are separate questions entirely.</p>

  <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Is eToro regulated?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">Yes. eToro is regulated by multiple top-tier financial authorities worldwide: the FCA in the UK, CySEC in Europe, ASIC in Australia, and FinCEN plus FINRA/SIPC in the US. Each entity operates under strict regulatory requirements including client fund segregation and capital adequacy rules.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">What happens to my money if eToro goes bankrupt?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">Client funds are held in segregated accounts, separate from eToro&rsquo;s own company funds. In the UK, the FSCS covers up to &pound;85,000 per person. In Europe, the ICF covers up to &euro;20,000. In the US, SIPC covers up to $500,000 in securities. These protections mean your money doesn&rsquo;t simply vanish if eToro were to fail.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Has anyone lost money on eToro?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">Yes &mdash; 51% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with eToro. This is a trading risk, not a platform safety risk. People lose money because markets go down, because leveraged positions move against them, or because they copy traders who underperform. eToro itself has not lost or stolen client funds.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Is eToro safe for beginners?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">The platform itself is safe and well-regulated. However, beginners face real risks from trading itself &mdash; especially with CFDs and leverage. eToro&rsquo;s copy trading feature can feel deceptively simple, but copied traders can and do lose money. Beginners should start with a small amount they can afford to lose and avoid leveraged products until they understand the risks.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Can I withdraw my money from eToro at any time?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">Yes. You can withdraw your available balance at any time. Withdrawals from a USD account carry a $5 fee with a $30 minimum. Local currency accounts (GBP, EUR, AUD, DKK) have free withdrawals with no minimum. Processing typically takes 1&ndash;3 business days. In nearly 10 years of using eToro, I have never had a withdrawal blocked or denied.</p>
