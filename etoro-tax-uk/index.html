          <strong>Risk Warning</strong>
          eToro is a multi-asset investment platform. The value of your investments may go up or down. 51% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with eToro. You should consider whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money. This content is for educational and informational purposes only — it is not investment advice.

        </div>

        <h2 id="do-you-pay-tax">Do You Pay Tax on eToro Profits in the UK?</h2>
        <p>Yes, in most cases. UK investors are subject to Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on profits from selling real assets — stocks, ETFs, and crypto — when those profits exceed the annual CGT allowance. As of the 2024/25 tax year, the CGT allowance is £3,000 per person.</p>
        <p>Income tax may also apply to dividends if they exceed the annual dividend allowance (£500 as of 2024/25), and to any income-type payments from certain eToro products.</p>
        <p>The tax you owe depends on your total gains across all investments in a tax year — not just eToro. If you&#x27;re also selling property, shares in other brokers, or crypto elsewhere, all of those gains count toward your total.</p>
        <p>Important: eToro does not withhold or pay UK tax on your behalf. You are responsible for declaring your own gains through Self Assessment if they exceed the relevant thresholds.</p>
        <p class="toms-note">I really want to flag here — I am not a tax professional, an accountant, or anything close. I&#x27;m just someone who had to figure out how tax on my eToro account worked and I&#x27;m sharing what I found. Tax rules change, and everyone&#x27;s situation is different. Please speak to a qualified accountant before making any tax decisions. This is genuinely one area where you should not rely on what I say here.</p>
        <h2 id="cgt-allowance">The Annual CGT Allowance</h2>
        <p>Every UK taxpayer has a Capital Gains Tax annual exempt amount. For 2024/25, this is £3,000. This means your first £3,000 of capital gains in a tax year are tax-free. Only gains above this threshold are taxable.</p>
        <p>The CGT rate for basic rate taxpayers is 18% on gains from assets other than residential property (this rate applies to shares and crypto as of the 2024 Budget). Higher rate taxpayers pay 24%. These rates were changed in the October 2024 Autumn Budget — make sure you&#x27;re using the current rates for your tax year.</p>
        <p>If your total gains for the year are below £3,000, you generally don&#x27;t need to report them to HMRC (though you may still need to complete a Self Assessment return for other reasons).</p>
        <h2 id="cfds-and-tax">CFDs and Tax on eToro</h2>
        <p>CFD profits are taxed differently from real asset gains. In the UK, CFD profits are treated as income from gambling or financial speculation — not capital gains. This means CFD profits do not use your CGT allowance and are instead taxed as income.</p>
        <p>However, HMRC&#x27;s treatment of CFDs can be complex. Professional traders are taxed differently from retail traders. If you&#x27;re making significant income from CFDs, speaking to an accountant is strongly recommended.</p>
        <p>The important distinction on eToro is between positions held as real assets (non-leveraged, not a CFD) and positions held as CFDs (leveraged positions, or short positions). For real stock positions, you are taxed under CGT rules. For CFD positions, HMRC rules are different.</p>
        <h2 id="etoro-tax-report">How to Get Your eToro Tax Report</h2>
        <p>eToro provides an annual account statement that summarises your gains, losses, dividends, and transactions for the year. To access it: log into your eToro account, go to the Portfolio section, select &#x27;Account Statement&#x27; or visit the relevant section in your account settings, and download the report for the relevant tax year.</p>
        <p>The eToro account statement is not formatted specifically for HMRC submission — it&#x27;s a data export. You&#x27;ll need to use the figures from this report to calculate your taxable gains. Many accountants and tax software tools (like TaxCalc or GoSimpleTax) can help you do this.</p>
        <p>eToro also offers integration with some crypto tax tools if you have significant crypto transactions. Tools like Koinly can import your eToro transaction history and calculate your crypto CGT automatically.</p>
        <h2 id="professional-advice">When to Get Professional Tax Advice</h2>
        <p>If your total investment gains across all platforms are well above the CGT allowance, it&#x27;s worth speaking to an accountant who handles investment tax. The cost of an accountant is usually much less than a tax mistake.</p>
        <p>You should definitely seek professional advice if: you&#x27;ve made large gains from crypto, you&#x27;re trading CFDs at significant scale, you have shares in multiple platforms and multiple tax years to reconcile, or you&#x27;re unsure whether you need to complete a Self Assessment return.</p>
        <p>Remember: this guide is general information for educational purposes only. It is not financial or tax advice. Tax rules change, and your specific situation may be different. Always verify the current rules with HMRC or a qualified tax adviser.</p>
