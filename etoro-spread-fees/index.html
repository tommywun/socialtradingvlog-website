          <strong>Risk Warning</strong>
          eToro is a multi-asset investment platform. The value of your investments may go up or down. 51% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with eToro. You should consider whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money. This content is for educational and informational purposes only &mdash; it is not investment advice.

        <h2 id="what-is-a-spread">What Is a Spread? (Explained Like You&#x27;re 10)</h2>

        <p>Imagine you&#x27;re at the airport and you need to change pounds into euros. You walk up to the currency exchange desk and notice two prices: one for buying euros and one for selling. The buy price is always a bit higher. That gap &mdash; the difference between the two prices &mdash; is how the exchange bureau makes their money. They don&#x27;t charge you a separate &#x27;fee&#x27; &mdash; they just give you a slightly worse rate on both sides.</p>

        <p>That&#x27;s exactly what a spread is. Every asset on eToro has two prices: a <strong>buy (ask) price</strong> and a <strong>sell (bid) price</strong>. The buy price is always slightly higher. The difference between them is the spread &mdash; the cost of doing business, baked right into the price.</p>

        <p>Quick example. Say a stock is showing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Buy price: $100.10</li>
          <li>Sell price: $99.90</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The spread is $0.20 (or 0.2%). If you bought and immediately sold, you&#x27;d lose $0.20 per share &mdash; not because the stock dropped, but because of the spread. That $0.20 is the broker&#x27;s cut.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">When I first started on eToro in 2016, I genuinely thought the platform was broken because my trades kept opening in the red. I even messaged support about it. Turns out &mdash; that&#x27;s just the spread. Once you understand it, it stops being confusing. But eToro could definitely do a better job of explaining this upfront to beginners.</p>

        <h2 id="how-etoro-spread-model-works">How eToro&#x27;s Spread Model Works</h2>

        <p>eToro is a &#x27;spread-based&#x27; broker. For most of its history, the platform made money primarily through spreads rather than commissions. That changed slightly in early 2025 when they introduced a per-trade commission on stocks ($1 or $2), but for every other asset class &mdash; crypto, forex, commodities, indices, and ETFs &mdash; the spread remains the main cost.</p>

        <p>Here&#x27;s how it works in practice:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>You open a trade.</strong> You pay the buy (ask) price, slightly above the mid-market price.</li>
          <li><strong>Your position starts slightly negative.</strong> The current sell price is lower than what you paid. That gap is the spread.</li>
          <li><strong>The market needs to move in your favour</strong> by at least the spread amount before you break even.</li>
          <li><strong>When you close,</strong> you receive the sell (bid) price.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>There&#x27;s no separate &#x27;spread fee&#x27; on your account statement. It&#x27;s built into the price itself &mdash; which is exactly why it confuses people.</p>

        <p>Important distinction: for <strong>real stock and ETF trades</strong> (no leverage, no short selling), the spread is the natural market spread &mdash; eToro doesn&#x27;t add a markup. For <strong>CFDs</strong> (leveraged trades, short positions, forex, commodities, indices), eToro sets the spread, and it&#x27;s generally wider.</p>

        <p>For a full breakdown of all eToro fees beyond just spreads, see my <a href="../etoro-fees/">complete eToro fees guide</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="spreads-by-asset-class">eToro Spreads by Asset Class</h2>

        <p>Spreads vary significantly depending on what you&#x27;re trading. Here&#x27;s a summary of the typical spreads you&#x27;ll encounter on eToro in 2026:</p>

        <div class="table-wrapper">
          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Asset Class</th>
                <th>Typical Spread</th>
                <th>Additional Costs</th>
                <th>Notes</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Stocks</strong></td>
                <td>~0.15%</td>
                <td>$1&ndash;$2 commission per trade (since 2025)</td>
                <td>Natural market spread only &mdash; no eToro markup</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Crypto</strong></td>
                <td>1% each way</td>
                <td>None</td>
                <td>2% round trip &mdash; this is high compared to dedicated crypto exchanges</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Forex</strong></td>
                <td>~1 pip on EUR/USD (variable)</td>
                <td>Overnight fees on CFDs</td>
                <td>Spreads vary by currency pair; majors are tightest</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Commodities</strong></td>
                <td>Variable &mdash; Gold ~45 pips, Oil ~5 pips</td>
                <td>Overnight fees on CFDs</td>
                <td>Spreads widen during volatile periods</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Indices</strong></td>
                <td>Variable &mdash; S&amp;P 500 ~0.75 points</td>
                <td>Overnight fees on CFDs</td>
                <td>Traded as CFDs; spreads vary by index</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>ETFs</strong></td>
                <td>~0.15%</td>
                <td>None (no commission)</td>
                <td>Natural market spread; still genuinely commission-free</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <p>A few things worth highlighting:</p>

        <p><strong>Crypto is the most expensive.</strong> At 1% each way (2% round trip), a $1,000 Bitcoin trade costs you $20 before the price even moves. This is where eToro is genuinely pricey compared to dedicated crypto platforms.</p>

        <p><strong>ETFs are the best deal.</strong> No commission, no markup &mdash; just the natural market spread, which is tiny for popular funds like SPY or Vanguard ETFs.</p>

        <p><strong>Forex spreads are competitive</strong> for a retail platform. Around 1 pip on EUR/USD is standard. Professional traders using ECN brokers might get tighter spreads, but for casual forex trading it&#x27;s in line with the market.</p>

        <p><strong>Stock spreads are tiny</strong> &mdash; the natural market spread on Apple, Tesla, or Microsoft is often just a few cents. The $1 commission eToro added in 2025 is actually a bigger cost than the spread itself for most stock trades.</p>

        <h2 id="real-trade-examples">Real Trade Examples: What I Actually Paid in Spreads</h2>

        <p>Theory is fine, but let me walk through some real numbers. These are representative examples based on typical spreads I see when trading on eToro.</p>

        <h3>Example 1: Buying $1,000 of Apple Stock</h3>
        <p>Let&#x27;s say Apple (AAPL) is trading at around $230 per share.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Buy price: $230.17</li>
          <li>Sell price: $230.00</li>
          <li>Spread: $0.17 per share (about 0.07%)</li>
          <li>Shares purchased with $1,000: ~4.34 shares</li>
          <li><strong>Spread cost: ~$0.74</strong></li>
          <li>Commission: $1.00 (per-trade fee)</li>
          <li><strong>Total cost to open: ~$1.74</strong></li>
          <li>Total round trip (open + close): ~$2.50 (including $1 commission on the close)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That&#x27;s incredibly cheap for a $1,000 trade. The spread on Apple is tiny because it&#x27;s one of the most liquid stocks in the world. The commission is actually the bigger cost here. If you&#x27;re buying and holding Apple for the long term, $2.50 for a $1,000 position is negligible.</p>

        <h3>Example 2: Buying $500 of Bitcoin</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Bitcoin price: ~$96,000 (February 2026)</li>
          <li>eToro crypto spread: 1% each way</li>
          <li>1% of $500 = <strong>$5 to open</strong></li>
          <li>1% of your position value to close = <strong>~$5 to close</strong> (assuming the price hasn&#x27;t moved much)</li>
          <li><strong>Total round-trip cost: ~$10</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>$10 on a $500 trade is 2%. On Coinbase or Kraken, you might pay 0.5&ndash;0.6% for the same trade. If you&#x27;re making frequent crypto trades on eToro, those spreads compound fast. I mostly hold crypto long-term, which makes the spread less painful since I&#x27;m not paying it repeatedly.</p>

        <h3>Example 3: Buying EUR/USD Forex at $1,000</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>EUR/USD price: ~1.0450</li>
          <li>Spread: ~1 pip (0.0001)</li>
          <li>With $1,000 and no leverage, 1 pip is worth roughly $0.10</li>
          <li><strong>Spread cost to open: ~$0.10</strong></li>
          <li>With 30:1 leverage (common for retail forex in Europe), 1 pip on a $30,000 position is worth ~$3</li>
          <li><strong>Spread cost with leverage: ~$3</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Forex spreads on eToro are reasonable for a retail platform. The catch with forex is that most people use leverage, which amplifies both the spread cost and the potential gains and losses. And don&#x27;t forget the overnight fees if you&#x27;re holding leveraged forex positions overnight &mdash; those add up far more than the spread over time.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">I don&#x27;t trade much forex myself. My main activity on eToro is copy trading, stocks, and ETFs. But when I have traded forex, the spread cost was the least of my worries compared to the overnight fees and leverage risk.</p>

        <h2 id="spreads-vs-commission">eToro Spreads vs. Commission-Based Brokers (True Cost Comparison)</h2>

        <p>Is eToro&#x27;s spread model cheaper or more expensive than commission-based brokers? Honestly &mdash; it depends on what you&#x27;re trading. Here&#x27;s a side-by-side comparison:</p>

        <h3>$1,000 Stock Trade (e.g., Apple)</h3>
        <div class="table-wrapper">
          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Broker</th>
                <th>Spread Cost</th>
                <th>Commission</th>
                <th>Total Round-Trip Cost</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>eToro</strong></td>
                <td>~$1.50 (market spread)</td>
                <td>$1 open + $1 close</td>
                <td><strong>~$3.50</strong></td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Trading 212</strong></td>
                <td>~$1.50 (market spread)</td>
                <td>$0</td>
                <td><strong>~$1.50</strong></td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>IBKR (Lite)</strong></td>
                <td>~$1.50 (market spread)</td>
                <td>$0</td>
                <td><strong>~$1.50</strong></td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>XTB</strong></td>
                <td>~$1.50 (market spread)</td>
                <td>$0 (under &euro;100k/month)</td>
                <td><strong>~$1.50</strong></td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <p>For stocks, eToro is now slightly more expensive because of the $1/$2 commission. Trading 212, IBKR Lite, and XTB all offer commission-free stock trading. The spread is roughly the same everywhere because they route to the same exchanges.</p>

        <p>For forex, the differences are smaller. eToro&#x27;s 1-pip spread on EUR/USD is competitive, and the difference between brokers is a few dollars per trade &mdash; not a dealbreaker for most people.</p>

        <p>Where eToro really loses on cost is <strong>crypto</strong> (1% each way vs. ~0.5% on Coinbase). For a broader comparison, see my <a href="../etoro-fees/">full eToro fees breakdown</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="when-spreads-are-wider">When Spreads Are Wider (And When to Avoid Trading)</h2>

        <p>Spreads aren&#x27;t fixed. They move throughout the day depending on market conditions. Here are the situations where you&#x27;ll typically see wider spreads &mdash; and when I personally try to avoid trading:</p>

        <h3>After Hours / Pre-Market</h3>
        <p>Trading US stocks outside regular hours (9:30am&ndash;4:00pm ET) means wider spreads due to lower liquidity. I&#x27;ve seen spreads 2&ndash;3 times wider during extended hours on some stocks.</p>

        <h3>During Major News Events</h3>
        <p>Fed rate decisions, NFP, CPI releases &mdash; spreads spike across all brokers during these moments. Market makers widen them because of uncertainty. If you&#x27;re not a news trader, just wait 15&ndash;30 minutes for things to settle.</p>

        <h3>Low Liquidity Periods</h3>
        <p>Early Monday mornings, late Friday afternoons, and holiday periods tend to have wider spreads. Fewer buyers and sellers means a bigger gap between best buy and sell prices.</p>

        <h3>Weekends for Crypto</h3>
        <p>eToro keeps crypto markets open over the weekend, but spreads can be wider with traditional markets closed. I&#x27;ve noticed crypto spreads creep up on Saturday evenings and Sunday mornings in particular.</p>

        <h3>Exotic / Low-Volume Assets</h3>
        <p>Small-cap stocks, exotic currency pairs (USD/TRY, EUR/ZAR), and less popular commodities naturally have wider spreads. This isn&#x27;t an eToro thing &mdash; it&#x27;s a market thing. Less volume means wider spreads everywhere.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">My personal rule: I avoid placing trades in the first 15 minutes after a market opens and during major economic announcements. Not because of some sophisticated strategy &mdash; just because spreads are at their worst during those moments, and I don&#x27;t want to give away money unnecessarily.</p>

        <h2 id="how-to-check-spread">How to Check the Spread Before You Trade on eToro</h2>

        <p>It&#x27;s straightforward once you know where to look:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Open the trade screen</strong> for any asset by tapping &#x27;Trade&#x27;.</li>
          <li><strong>Look at the buy and sell prices.</strong> You&#x27;ll see two buttons &mdash; Buy (ask price) and Sell (bid price). The gap between them is the spread.</li>
          <li><strong>Tap &#x27;Estimated Cost&#x27;</strong> before confirming. This shows the total expected cost including spread and any commission.</li>
          <li><strong>Check the asset&#x27;s info page.</strong> eToro often lists the &#x27;typical spread&#x27; for each instrument (though it can be wider during volatile periods).</li>
        </ol>

        <p>For CFDs, you can also check eToro&#x27;s official fees page at etoro.com/trading/fees for minimum and typical spreads. Or use the <a href="../calculators/fee-calculator/">eToro fee calculator</a> on this site to estimate total costs before you trade.</p>

        <h2 id="tips-minimise-spread-costs">Tips to Minimise Spread Costs</h2>

        <p>You can&#x27;t eliminate spreads &mdash; they&#x27;re a fundamental part of how markets work. But you can minimise what you pay. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned over nearly 10 years of trading on eToro:</p>

        <h3>1. Trade During Regular Market Hours</h3>
        <p>For US stocks, that&#x27;s 9:30am&ndash;4:00pm ET (2:30pm&ndash;9:00pm UK). Spreads are tightest when the market is busiest.</p>

        <h3>2. Avoid Volatile Moments</h3>
        <p>Don&#x27;t trade right at market open, during major economic announcements, or earnings releases. Give it 15&ndash;30 minutes for spreads to settle.</p>

        <h3>3. Stick to Liquid Assets</h3>
        <p>Apple, Microsoft, S&amp;P 500, EUR/USD &mdash; these have tiny spreads because millions trade them daily. Obscure small-caps and exotic forex pairs have much wider spreads.</p>

        <h3>4. Think About Round-Trip Cost</h3>
        <p>You pay the spread on open <em>and</em> close. For crypto that&#x27;s 1% + 1% = 2%. Consider whether frequent small trades are worth the total cost.</p>

        <h3>5. Use the Fee Calculator</h3>
        <p>Run the numbers through the <a href="../calculators/fee-calculator/">eToro fee calculator</a> before committing. It shows estimated total cost including spread, commission, and overnight fees.</p>

        <h3>6. Consider ETFs Instead of Individual Stocks</h3>
        <p>ETFs on eToro are still commission-free (as of February 2026). A fund like Vanguard S&amp;P 500 (VOO) gives you 500 stocks with zero commission and negligible spread &mdash; the cheapest way to invest on the platform.</p>

        <h3>7. Hold Longer, Trade Less</h3>
        <p>The simplest and most effective tip. Every round trip costs you the spread. Buy quality assets and hold for months or years, and the spread is a one-time cost that becomes irrelevant. Day trading multiplies your spread costs.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">Honestly, for most people using eToro as a long-term investing platform &mdash; buying stocks, ETFs, copying traders &mdash; the spread is a minor cost. Where it really matters is if you&#x27;re doing frequent crypto trades (2% round trip adds up), or if you&#x27;re day-trading CFDs where every pip of spread eats into your edge. For my copy trading portfolio, I barely think about spreads because I&#x27;m holding positions for weeks or months.</p>

  <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">What is the spread on eToro?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">The spread is the difference between the buy (ask) price and the sell (bid) price of an asset. It&#x27;s built into every trade on eToro and is one of the main ways the platform makes money. You don&#x27;t see it as a separate fee &mdash; your position simply opens slightly in the red because of the spread.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Does eToro charge commission on top of the spread?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">For most asset classes &mdash; crypto, forex, commodities, indices &mdash; the spread is the only trading cost. However, since early 2025, eToro also charges a $1 or $2 commission per trade on individual stocks (not ETFs). So for stocks, you&#x27;re paying both a spread and a commission. See my <a href="../etoro-fees/">full eToro fees guide</a> for the complete breakdown.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Why is the eToro crypto spread so high?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">eToro charges a 1% spread each way on crypto, making the round-trip cost 2%. This is significantly higher than dedicated crypto exchanges like Coinbase or Binance. The trade-off is that eToro offers a regulated, all-in-one platform where you can hold stocks, ETFs, and crypto in the same account. If crypto trading is your main activity, a dedicated exchange will be cheaper.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Can I see the spread before I trade on eToro?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">Yes. On the trade screen, eToro shows both the buy price and the sell price. The gap between them is the spread. You can also tap &#x27;Estimated Cost&#x27; before confirming a trade to see the total cost breakdown including spread and any commission.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">When are eToro spreads widest?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">Spreads tend to be widest during after-hours trading, around major news events (like Fed interest rate decisions or CPI data releases), on weekends for crypto, and during periods of low market liquidity. Trading during regular market hours typically gives you the tightest spreads.</p>
