        <p class="article-intro">I&#x27;ve been using eToro since 2016 &mdash; nearly 10 years now &mdash; and I&#x27;ve withdrawn money more times than I can count. The $5 withdrawal fee gets all the attention, but it&#x27;s honestly not the cost that&#x27;s caught me out over the years. The real expense most people miss is the currency conversion fee, and it can quietly eat into your returns if you&#x27;re not aware of it. This is my honest breakdown of every cost involved in withdrawing from eToro in 2026, based on real experience doing it myself over and over again.</p>

          <strong>Risk Warning</strong>
          eToro is a multi-asset investment platform. The value of your investments may go up or down. 51% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with eToro. You should consider whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money. This content is for educational and informational purposes only &mdash; it is not investment advice.

        <h2 id="withdrawal-fee">eToro&#x27;s Official Withdrawal Fee</h2>
        <p class="toms-note">The fee information on this page is taken from eToro&#x27;s official fees page (etoro.com/trading/fees) and reflects my own experience as a long-term user. Fees can change, so always check eToro&#x27;s live fees page before making any decisions. This is not financial advice &mdash; I&#x27;m a regular eToro user, not a financial adviser.</p>

        <p>Let&#x27;s start with the headline number. If you have a <strong>USD account</strong> on eToro, every withdrawal costs a flat <strong>$5</strong>. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether you&#x27;re withdrawing $50 or $5,000 &mdash; it&#x27;s always $5. That&#x27;s it. No percentage-based charge, no sliding scale. Just a flat five dollars.</p>

        <p>Now here&#x27;s the part that a lot of people don&#x27;t realise: if you have a <strong>local currency account</strong> &mdash; that&#x27;s GBP, EUR, AUD, or DKK through eToro Money &mdash; <strong>withdrawals are completely free</strong>. No fee at all. This is a relatively newer option that eToro has rolled out, and it&#x27;s genuinely a good deal if your local currency is supported.</p>

        <p>When I first started on eToro back in 2016, there was only the USD account option and the $5 fee was just part of the deal. These days, if I were starting fresh, I&#x27;d seriously consider the local currency account route to avoid this fee entirely.</p>

        <p>To be clear: the $5 fee applies per withdrawal, not per month or per year. If you withdraw three times in a month from a USD account, you&#x27;ll pay $15 in withdrawal fees. That&#x27;s why the strategy of withdrawing less frequently but in larger amounts makes so much sense &mdash; more on that later.</p>

        <h2 id="currency-conversion">The Hidden Cost Most People Miss: Currency Conversion</h2>

        <p>This is the section I really want you to pay attention to, because it&#x27;s the one that catches most people off guard &mdash; myself included, early on.</p>

        <p>If you deposit in a currency other than USD (say GBP or EUR) into a USD-denominated eToro account, a <strong>currency conversion fee of 0.5% (50 pips)</strong> applies. This conversion happens both when you deposit and when you withdraw. So the fee effectively hits you twice over the lifecycle of your money on the platform.</p>

        <p>Let me put that in real numbers. Say you&#x27;re a UK investor and you deposit &pound;2,000 into your USD eToro account. That&#x27;s roughly $2,500 at current rates. The 0.5% conversion fee on the way in costs you about $12.50. Then when you withdraw the same amount, it&#x27;s another 0.5% on the way out &mdash; another $12.50 or so. That&#x27;s <strong>$25 total in conversion fees</strong> on a $2,500 round trip. Compare that to the $5 flat withdrawal fee that everyone fixates on.</p>

        <p>For larger amounts, the gap is even more dramatic. On a $10,000 withdrawal, the conversion fee alone would be $50 &mdash; ten times the flat withdrawal fee. <strong>The conversion fee is almost always the bigger cost</strong>, and yet it&#x27;s the $5 that gets all the search queries and all the complaints on Reddit.</p>

        <p>This is one of the main reasons eToro introduced local currency accounts. If you deposit GBP into a GBP account and trade GBP-denominated assets, you can avoid this conversion fee altogether. The conversion fee only applies when there&#x27;s an actual currency exchange happening.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">I&#x27;ve paid more in conversion fees over the years than I care to add up. If I had one piece of advice for new UK or European eToro users, it&#x27;s this: understand the conversion fee before you deposit. It&#x27;s not a scam &mdash; every broker that handles multi-currency accounts charges something similar &mdash; but you need to factor it in.</p>

        <h2 id="minimum-withdrawal">Minimum Withdrawal Amount</h2>

        <p>For <strong>USD accounts</strong>, the minimum withdrawal amount is <strong>$30</strong>. You can&#x27;t withdraw anything less than that. Given that there&#x27;s a $5 fee on every withdrawal, pulling out the minimum $30 would cost you roughly 17% in fees alone &mdash; which is obviously terrible value. This is another reason to withdraw larger amounts less frequently.</p>

        <p>For <strong>local currency accounts</strong> (GBP, EUR, AUD, DKK), there is <strong>no minimum withdrawal amount</strong>. Combined with the fact that withdrawals are free, this makes local currency accounts significantly more flexible for people who want to take out smaller amounts occasionally.</p>

        <p>One thing to keep in mind: your available balance for withdrawal is your total cash balance minus any margin used by open positions. If most of your money is invested, you may not have as much available to withdraw as you think. eToro won&#x27;t let you withdraw money that&#x27;s being used as margin for open trades. You&#x27;d need to <a href="../how-to-close-etoro-account/">close positions first</a> to free up those funds.</p>

        <h2 id="processing-times">Withdrawal Processing Times by Payment Method</h2>

        <p>eToro typically processes withdrawal requests within <strong>1&ndash;2 business days</strong> on their end. After that, how long it takes to actually land in your account depends on the payment method you&#x27;re withdrawing to.</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Payment Method</th>
              <th>eToro Processing</th>
              <th>Total Time (Approx.)</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>PayPal</td>
              <td>1&ndash;2 business days</td>
              <td>1&ndash;2 business days</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Skrill</td>
              <td>1&ndash;2 business days</td>
              <td>1&ndash;2 business days</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Neteller</td>
              <td>1&ndash;2 business days</td>
              <td>1&ndash;2 business days</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Bank Transfer</td>
              <td>1&ndash;2 business days</td>
              <td>3&ndash;8 business days</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Credit/Debit Card</td>
              <td>1&ndash;2 business days</td>
              <td>3&ndash;8 business days</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>In my experience, <strong>PayPal is the fastest</strong>. I&#x27;ve had withdrawals land in my PayPal account within a day on more than one occasion. Bank transfers are the slowest and most variable &mdash; sometimes it&#x27;s three days, sometimes it drags on closer to a week, depending on your bank and country.</p>

        <p>One important rule: <strong>eToro sends withdrawals back to the same payment method you used to deposit</strong>. If you deposited via bank transfer, your withdrawal goes back to that bank account. If you deposited via PayPal, it goes back to PayPal. You can&#x27;t deposit by card and then withdraw to a different PayPal account. This is an anti-money-laundering requirement, and it trips people up regularly.</p>

        <p>If you&#x27;ve deposited using multiple methods, eToro follows a specific order: credit/debit card refunds first (up to the amount deposited by card), then the rest via your chosen method. It can feel confusing, but it&#x27;s standard across regulated brokers.</p>

        <h2 id="how-to-withdraw">How to Withdraw From eToro (Step-by-Step)</h2>

        <p>I&#x27;ve done this so many times it&#x27;s second nature, but I remember the first time being slightly confusing. Here&#x27;s exactly how it works:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Log in to your eToro account</strong> (web or mobile app &mdash; both work).</li>
          <li><strong>Click on the menu icon</strong> (bottom left on mobile, or the sidebar on desktop) and select <strong>&ldquo;Withdraw Funds&rdquo;</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Enter the amount</strong> you want to withdraw. Remember: $30 minimum for USD accounts, no minimum for local currency accounts.</li>
          <li><strong>Confirm the payment method</strong>. eToro will show you where the money is going &mdash; it defaults to the method you used to deposit.</li>
          <li><strong>Submit the request</strong>. You&#x27;ll get a confirmation email from eToro.</li>
          <li><strong>Wait for processing</strong>. Check your withdrawal status in the &ldquo;Portfolio&rdquo; or &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; section &mdash; it&#x27;ll show as &ldquo;Pending&rdquo; and then &ldquo;Processed&rdquo;.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>That&#x27;s genuinely it. The interface is straightforward. The only thing that can slow you down is if your account isn&#x27;t fully verified &mdash; eToro requires complete KYC (Know Your Customer) verification before they&#x27;ll process any withdrawal. If you haven&#x27;t already uploaded your ID and proof of address, do that well before you need to withdraw. Don&#x27;t wait until you want your money out.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">One thing I always do: I screenshot the withdrawal confirmation screen and save the confirmation email. I&#x27;ve never had a withdrawal go missing, but having a record gives me peace of mind &mdash; especially for larger amounts.</p>

        <h2 id="minimise-costs">How to Minimise Your Withdrawal Costs (My Strategy After 10 Years)</h2>

        <p>After nearly a decade on eToro, I&#x27;ve worked out a few things that actually make a difference to what you pay in withdrawal costs. None of this is rocket science, but it adds up.</p>

        <h3>1. Withdraw larger amounts less often</h3>
        <p>This is the simplest one. Since the $5 fee is flat per withdrawal (on USD accounts), withdrawing $1,000 once costs you $5 in fees. Withdrawing $200 five times costs you $25. Same total amount, five times the fee. I try to batch my withdrawals and take out a larger sum every few months rather than dipping in and out regularly.</p>

        <h3>2. Consider a local currency account</h3>
        <p>If you&#x27;re in the UK, Europe, Australia, or Denmark, eToro&#x27;s local currency accounts eliminate the $5 withdrawal fee entirely and remove the minimum withdrawal amount. They also reduce or eliminate the currency conversion fee for assets denominated in your local currency. This is the single most impactful thing most non-US users can do.</p>

        <h3>3. Be aware of the conversion fee and plan around it</h3>
        <p>If you&#x27;re on a USD account and depositing in GBP or EUR, you&#x27;re paying 0.5% each way. There&#x27;s no way around that on a standard account. But if you&#x27;re a higher-tier eToro Club member, the conversion fee is reduced. That leads to the next point.</p>

        <h3>4. Leverage eToro Club tier benefits</h3>
        <p>eToro Club membership is based on your account balance, and higher tiers offer reduced currency conversion fees:</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>eToro Club Tier</th>
              <th>Balance Required</th>
              <th>Conversion Fee</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Silver</td>
              <td>$5,000</td>
              <td>0.5% (standard)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Gold</td>
              <td>$10,000</td>
              <td>0.4%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Platinum</td>
              <td>$25,000</td>
              <td>0.25%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Platinum+</td>
              <td>$50,000</td>
              <td>0.25%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Diamond</td>
              <td>$250,000</td>
              <td>0.1%</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>At Diamond tier, you&#x27;re paying just 0.1% in conversion fees &mdash; that&#x27;s a massive reduction from the standard 0.5%. For a full breakdown of all eToro&#x27;s fees including Club tier benefits, see my <a href="../etoro-fees/">complete eToro fees guide</a>.</p>

        <h3>5. Use PayPal for speed (if it matters to you)</h3>
        <p>If you want your money fast, withdrawing to PayPal is consistently the quickest option in my experience. The fee is the same regardless of payment method, so you might as well pick the fastest one if speed matters.</p>

        <p>On paper, eToro&#x27;s $5 fee for USD accounts looks worse than most competitors. But context matters. Trading 212 and DEGIRO don&#x27;t offer the same copy trading and social features. Plus500 is a CFD-only platform. Interactive Brokers is excellent but has a steeper learning curve.</p>

        <p>If you&#x27;re using eToro&#x27;s local currency account, the withdrawal fee comparison becomes a non-issue &mdash; it&#x27;s free, same as everyone else. The real differentiator is the currency conversion fee, and that&#x27;s where eToro can be more expensive than platforms like Trading 212 which handle multi-currency accounts natively.</p>

        <p>For a deeper dive into all of eToro&#x27;s costs versus other platforms, I&#x27;ve covered this in my <a href="../etoro-fees/">full eToro fees breakdown</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="common-problems">Common Withdrawal Problems and How to Fix Them</h2>

        <p>Over the years, I&#x27;ve seen (and experienced) a few common issues that delay or block withdrawals. Here&#x27;s what to watch for:</p>

        <h3>Verification delays</h3>
        <p>eToro requires full KYC verification before processing withdrawals. That means a valid government ID and proof of address. If you haven&#x27;t completed this, your withdrawal will sit in limbo until you do. My advice: get verified the day you open your account, not the day you want to withdraw. The verification process can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days depending on how busy they are.</p>

        <h3>Wrong payment method</h3>
        <p>As I mentioned earlier, eToro sends withdrawals back to the same method you deposited with. If you deposited with a card that&#x27;s since expired or been cancelled, this can cause problems. You&#x27;ll need to contact eToro support to sort it out. It&#x27;s not the end of the world, but it does add delays &mdash; sometimes a week or more.</p>

        <h3>Funds tied up in open positions</h3>
        <p>Your available withdrawal balance is your cash balance minus any margin being used by open positions. If you&#x27;ve got $5,000 in your account but $4,800 is invested, you can only withdraw from the remaining $200 (minus the $30 minimum and $5 fee for USD accounts). If you want to withdraw more, you&#x27;ll need to close some positions first. Check my guide on <a href="../how-to-close-etoro-account/">how to close your eToro account</a> if you&#x27;re looking to pull everything out.</p>

        <h3>Withdrawal request stuck on &ldquo;Pending&rdquo;</h3>
        <p>If your withdrawal has been pending for more than 3 business days, something might be wrong. Check your email for any messages from eToro &mdash; they sometimes need additional documentation. If there&#x27;s nothing in your inbox, contact eToro support directly through the platform. In my experience their support team is reasonably responsive, if not always fast.</p>

        <h3>Receiving less than expected</h3>
        <p>This is almost always the currency conversion fee at work. If you withdrew $1,000 from a USD account but deposited in GBP, the 0.5% conversion fee means you&#x27;ll receive roughly $995 worth of GBP. The $5 withdrawal fee is deducted separately from your eToro balance before the transfer. If the amount looks noticeably wrong beyond those two costs, contact support.</p>

  <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">How much does eToro charge to withdraw?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">eToro charges a flat $5 fee for withdrawals from USD accounts. If you have a local currency account (GBP, EUR, AUD or DKK), withdrawals are completely free. On top of this, if your account currency differs from the currency you deposited in, a currency conversion fee of up to 0.5% (50 pips) may apply.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">What is the minimum withdrawal amount on eToro?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">The minimum withdrawal from a USD account is $30. If you have a local currency account (GBP, EUR, AUD or DKK), there is no minimum withdrawal amount.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">How long does an eToro withdrawal take?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">eToro typically processes withdrawal requests within 1&ndash;2 business days. After processing, the time to receive funds depends on your payment method: PayPal and Skrill are usually 1&ndash;2 business days, while bank transfers and credit/debit cards can take 3&ndash;8 business days.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Can I avoid the eToro withdrawal fee?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">Yes. If you open a local currency account (GBP, EUR, AUD or DKK) through eToro Money, withdrawals are free with no minimum. For USD accounts, the $5 fee applies to every withdrawal regardless of the amount or your eToro Club tier.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Why is my eToro withdrawal taking so long?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">The most common reasons for delayed withdrawals are: incomplete account verification (KYC), attempting to withdraw to a payment method different from the one used to deposit, having funds tied up in open positions, or bank processing times. Make sure your account is fully verified and you have sufficient available balance (not invested in open trades) before requesting a withdrawal.</p>
