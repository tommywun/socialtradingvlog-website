        <h2 id="what-is-the-risk-score">What Is eToro&#x27;s Risk Score?</h2>
        <p>eToro&#x27;s risk score is an automatically calculated number between 1 and 10 that measures the volatility and potential downside of a trader&#x27;s portfolio. A score of 1 means very low volatility and limited downside risk. A score of 10 means extreme volatility and potentially very large losses in a short period.</p>
        <p>The score is calculated weekly based on the previous 7-day period. It looks at leverage usage, position size relative to portfolio, asset volatility, and the historical drawdowns of the positions held. The exact algorithm isn&#x27;t published by eToro, but those are the main inputs.</p>
        <p>Importantly, the risk score updates in real time as a trader&#x27;s portfolio changes. A trader can have a risk score of 3 one week and 8 the next if they suddenly start taking on heavy leverage. This makes the risk score useful as a real-time signal of what the trader is currently doing, not just what they&#x27;ve done historically.</p>
        <h2 id="how-calculated">How the Risk Score Is Calculated</h2>
        <p>While eToro doesn&#x27;t publish the precise formula, the main factors are: leverage usage on open positions, exposure to high-volatility assets (small-cap stocks, altcoins, leveraged ETFs), portfolio concentration (how much is in a single position), and realised volatility of the portfolio over the past week.</p>
        <p>A trader who holds a diversified set of blue-chip stocks at x1 leverage will consistently score low — typically 1–3. A trader who is 50% in a leveraged crypto position will score very high — 7–10. A trader who mixes both will score somewhere in the middle.</p>
        <p>The daily average of the weekly score is what you see on the profile. This means a single high-risk day doesn&#x27;t spike the score dramatically, but a week of consistently high leverage usage will push the score up noticeably.</p>
        <h2 id="score-levels">What Each Score Level Means in Practice</h2>
        <p>Scores 1–3: Low risk. This trader is likely holding diversified, non-leveraged real assets. Expect lower returns, but also much shallower drawdowns. These are typically long-term investors who hold positions for weeks or months.</p>
        <p>Scores 4–6: Moderate risk. Some leverage usage, or concentration in more volatile assets, but still within manageable limits. This range covers a lot of copy trading&#x27;s &#x27;sweet spot&#x27; — traders who are active enough to generate decent returns without blowing up in bad conditions.</p>
        <p>Scores 7–8: High risk. Significant leverage, concentrated positions, or very volatile assets. These traders can generate big returns, but the downside can be equally dramatic. Proceed with caution and keep your copy allocation small.</p>
        <p>Scores 9–10: Extreme risk. This is usually a trader who is heavily leveraged on volatile assets. Even a small adverse move can cause large losses. I wouldn&#x27;t copy anyone consistently in this range.</p>
        <p class="toms-note">These are just my personal rules of thumb — I&#x27;m not a professional trader or financial analyst. I&#x27;ve built up these preferences through trial and error over the years. What works for me might not work for you, and nothing here should be taken as financial advice.</p>
        <h2 id="why-low-isnt-always-better">Why a Low Score Isn&#x27;t Always What You Want</h2>
        <p>It&#x27;s tempting to filter for the lowest risk scores when looking for copy traders. But a score of 1 doesn&#x27;t mean a trader is good — it means they&#x27;re taking very little risk. A trader scoring 1 who makes 4% per year isn&#x27;t particularly useful for someone looking for meaningful investment returns.</p>
        <p>The risk score measures risk-taking, not skill. A highly skilled trader might consistently score 5–6 because they&#x27;re actively managing a portfolio with some leverage and volatility — and that&#x27;s fine. The question isn&#x27;t whether the score is low; it&#x27;s whether the returns are commensurate with the risk being taken.</p>
        <p>A good sign is a trader whose risk score is consistently moderate (4–6) and whose returns are solid. That suggests a disciplined, repeatable approach. What you want to avoid is a trader whose risk score is consistently high (7+) chasing returns with leverage.</p>
        <h2 id="toms-usage">How Tom Uses the Risk Score</h2>
        <p>I use the risk score as a filter, not a ranking. My rule is: no one who has averaged above 6 in the past three months makes it into my portfolio. That immediately removes the most aggressive traders from consideration.</p>
        <p>I then look at the history of the risk score — not just the current number. A trader who is currently scoring 4 but was scoring 8–9 six months ago is showing a change in behaviour that I want to understand before copying. Were they recovering from big losses? Did they change strategy?</p>
        <p>The risk score graph over time tells a story. A flat line around 3–4 indicates consistent, predictable behaviour. A jagged line that bounces between 2 and 9 suggests erratic behaviour — someone whose strategy changes often. I prefer consistency, even if the average score is slightly higher.</p>
