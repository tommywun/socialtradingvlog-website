          <strong>Risk Warning</strong>
          eToro is a multi-asset investment platform. The value of your investments may go up or down. 51% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with eToro. You should consider whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money. This content is for educational and informational purposes only — it is not investment advice.

        <h2 id="why-selection-matters">Why Trader Selection Is Everything</h2>
        <p>Copy trading puts your money on autopilot — but only in the sense that your money follows whoever you&#x27;ve chosen to copy. The whole system depends on finding traders who are genuinely skilled, not just on a lucky run.</p>
        <p>The danger is that eToro&#x27;s default sorting puts the highest recent-return traders at the top of the list. A trader up 300% in the last year looks incredible. They&#x27;re also almost certainly taking on enormous risk to get that number — and the risk is now yours too.</p>
        <p>The best copy traders I&#x27;ve found over the years don&#x27;t top the leaderboards. They have quieter, more consistent profiles that take a bit more digging to appreciate.</p>
        <p class="toms-note">To be clear — I&#x27;ve got this wrong plenty of times myself. I&#x27;m not some expert stock-picker who cracked the code. I&#x27;m just someone who&#x27;s made the obvious mistakes early on and tried to learn from them. Take my suggestions as a starting point for your own research, not as a guarantee of anything.</p>
        <h2 id="stats-to-look-at">The Stats That Actually Matter</h2>
        <p>Track record length: I won&#x27;t copy anyone with less than two years of live trading history on eToro. One good year can be luck. A consistent track record over multiple years — including at least one volatile market period — is much harder to fake.</p>
        <p>Annual return: I look for traders generating 15–40% per year. Anything much higher than 40% consistently suggests they&#x27;re taking on extreme risk. Anything lower than 10% might not justify the effort of monitoring the copy.</p>
        <p>Maximum drawdown: This shows the worst peak-to-trough loss in the trader&#x27;s history. I won&#x27;t copy traders whose maximum drawdown exceeds 40–50%. A trader who once dropped 60% from their peak may recover, but that&#x27;s a brutal period to sit through if it happens again.</p>
        <p>Risk score: eToro&#x27;s risk score runs from 1 to 10. I generally avoid anyone consistently above 6–7. High risk scores often mean heavy leverage, frequent trading, and volatile positions. Lower risk scores suggest more conservative portfolio management.</p>
        <p>Profitable weeks/months: Look at the percentage of profitable weeks over the past year. I look for traders who are profitable in 55–70% of weeks. Much higher than that sometimes indicates a strategy that wins often but loses big when it does lose.</p>
        <h2 id="consistency-over-performance">Consistency Is More Important Than Raw Returns</h2>
        <p>The most important thing I&#x27;ve learned about copy trading is that you want boring consistency, not exciting performance. A trader who makes 20% every year, with shallow drawdowns, and doesn&#x27;t have a single catastrophic year, is worth far more than someone who made 150% once and then lost it all.</p>
        <p>Look at the monthly chart of a trader&#x27;s gains. You want to see relatively smooth, upward-trending performance — not a hockey stick shape where they made all their returns in one lucky month. Smooth performance suggests a repeatable process. A hockey stick suggests luck, or a strategy that works in one specific market condition.</p>
        <p>I also look at how the trader performed during periods of high market volatility — the COVID crash of 2020, the rate-hike sell-off of 2022. Traders who held their positions without panicking during those periods (and recovered well) tend to be far more trustworthy long-term copiers.</p>
        <h2 id="red-flags">Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
        <p>Heavy leverage usage: If a trader is consistently using 10x or 20x leverage, they&#x27;re gambling. A short run of bad luck will wipe the account. Check their positions in the portfolio tab — if you see lots of high-leverage CFDs, be very cautious.</p>
        <p>Very high trade frequency: A trader opening dozens of positions a day, every day, is often using a strategy that relies on small, frequent wins. These strategies can work for a while, then fail spectacularly. They also generate lots of spread fees, which quietly erode your returns.</p>
        <p>Sudden strategy changes: If a trader has a stable long-term investing style and then suddenly starts opening lots of high-risk trades, that&#x27;s a red flag. It might mean they&#x27;re trying to recover losses, or their circumstances have changed. Either way, it warrants caution.</p>
        <p>New account with spectacular returns: Any account under 12 months old with 100%+ returns should be treated with extreme scepticism. It&#x27;s either unsustainably risky, cherry-picked performance, or luck.</p>
        <h2 id="toms-checklist">Tom&#x27;s Personal Checklist</h2>
        <p>Before copying anyone, I go through this checklist. They need to pass all of them, not just most.</p>
        <p>First: at least 24 months of live trading history on eToro. Second: average annual return between 15% and 40%. Third: maximum drawdown under 40%. Fourth: risk score consistently 6 or below. Fifth: profitable in at least 55% of weeks. Sixth: no single month of more than 25% gain (usually means extreme risk). Seventh: active in recent months — not someone who&#x27;s stopped trading.</p>
        <p>If they pass all seven, I&#x27;ll copy them with a small amount first — typically £200–£500 — and watch how they behave over one to three months before increasing my allocation. Patience at this stage saves a lot of heartache.</p>
        <p>Finally: I diversify across at least five traders with different trading styles and asset classes. If one fails, it shouldn&#x27;t sink the whole portfolio.</p>
        <p class="toms-note">This checklist is based purely on my personal experience — not professional training. I&#x27;ve just been doing this since 2017 and tried to figure out what works. Please do your own research too, and remember that past performance of any trader is never a guarantee of future results.</p>
