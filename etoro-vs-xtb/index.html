          <strong>Risk Warning</strong>
          eToro is a multi-asset investment platform. The value of your investments may go up or down. 51% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with eToro. You should consider whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money. This content is for educational and informational purposes only &mdash; it is not investment advice.

        </div>

        <!-- ==================== OVERVIEW ==================== -->

        <h2 id="overview">Overview of Both Platforms</h2>

        <p><strong>eToro</strong> was founded in 2007 and has over 35 million users globally. It is regulated by the FCA, CySEC, ASIC, and FinCEN. Its standout feature is <strong>CopyTrader</strong> &mdash; the ability to automatically mirror other investors&#x27; trades. It offers real stocks, ETFs, CFDs, and 80+ cryptocurrencies with real ownership.</p>

        <p><strong>XTB</strong> (X-Trade Brokers) was founded in 2002 in Poland and is publicly traded on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. It is regulated by the FCA (UK), KNF (Poland), CySEC, and several other authorities. XTB is known for its <strong>award-winning xStation 5 platform</strong>, competitive forex spreads, and commission-free stock trading up to &euro;100,000 per month in turnover. It offers real stocks and ETFs, plus CFDs on forex, indices, commodities, and crypto.</p>

        <p>Both are strong all-round platforms, but eToro leans towards social and copy trading, while XTB leans towards active trading with a superior platform experience.</p>

        <!-- ==================== PLATFORM SHOWDOWN ==================== -->

        <h2 id="platform-showdown">Platform Showdown: xStation 5 vs eToro</h2>

        <p>This is the headline comparison. XTB&#x27;s <strong>xStation 5</strong> is widely regarded as one of the best proprietary trading platforms in the industry. It has won multiple awards for its charting capabilities, execution speed, and user experience. The platform includes advanced charting with drawing tools, market sentiment data built directly into the interface, a clean trade ticket, and real-time market analysis.</p>

        <p>eToro&#x27;s web platform is clean, social, and approachable. It is designed for accessibility rather than power. The social feed, CopyTrader interface, and portfolio view are intuitive. But eToro&#x27;s charting tools are basic compared to xStation 5, and there is no built-in market sentiment data or advanced order types.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">If I were purely evaluating the trading platform &mdash; ignoring copy trading entirely &mdash; xStation 5 is the better product. The charting is sharper, the execution feels faster, and the market sentiment data is genuinely useful. But I do not use eToro for its charting. I use it for copy trading, which xStation 5 does not have.</p>

        <!-- ==================== FEES ==================== -->

        <h2 id="fees-comparison">Fees Compared</h2>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Fee Type</th><th>XTB</th><th>eToro</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td><strong>Stock Commission</strong></td><td>$0 up to &euro;100K/month; 0.2% above</td><td>$0</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Stock CFD Spreads</strong></td><td>From 0.1%</td><td>~0.15%</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Forex Spreads</strong></td><td>From 0.1 pips (EUR/USD ~0.9 pips typical)</td><td>EUR/USD ~1.0 pip typical</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Withdrawal Fee</strong></td><td>$0 (free)</td><td>$5</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Inactivity Fee</strong></td><td>&euro;10/month after 12 months</td><td>$10/month after 12 months</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Currency Conversion</strong></td><td>0.5%</td><td>0.5%</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Interest on Cash</strong></td><td>Yes (where available)</td><td>Limited</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Minimum Deposit</strong></td><td>$0</td><td>$50&ndash;$200</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Fractional Shares</strong></td><td>Yes (from &euro;1)</td><td>Yes (from $10)</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>The fee structures are remarkably similar. Both offer commission-free stock trading, both charge the same currency conversion rate (0.5%), and both have a similar inactivity fee. The key differences: XTB has free withdrawals and no minimum deposit. XTB also pays interest on uninvested cash in some jurisdictions, which eToro does not.</p>

        <p>XTB&#x27;s commission-free stock trading has a &euro;100,000/month turnover threshold &mdash; above that, a 0.2% commission applies. For most retail investors, this threshold is more than sufficient.</p>

        <!-- ==================== STOCK INVESTING ==================== -->

        <h2 id="stock-investing">Stock Investing</h2>

        <p>Both platforms offer commission-free real stock and ETF investing. XTB provides access to <strong>3,000+ stocks from 16 exchanges</strong>, while eToro offers <strong>5,000+ instruments across ~17 exchanges</strong>. The selection is comparable for most investors.</p>

        <p>XTB has a slight edge with fractional shares starting from just &euro;1 (vs eToro&#x27;s $10 minimum). XTB also offers a &ldquo;Plans&rdquo; feature for automated recurring investments, similar to a regular savings plan.</p>

        <p>For basic stock investing, either platform works well. The differences are marginal. The decision between them really comes down to whether you want copy trading (eToro) or a better active trading platform (XTB).</p>

        <!-- ==================== FOREX ==================== -->

        <h2 id="forex-trading">Forex Trading: XTB&#x27;s Clear Advantage</h2>

        <p>This is where XTB pulls significantly ahead. XTB offers <strong>57+ forex pairs with spreads from 0.1 pips</strong>. The typical EUR/USD spread on XTB is around 0.9 pips, compared to eToro&#x27;s typical 1.0 pip. On other pairs, the difference can be larger.</p>

        <p>More importantly, xStation 5 is built for active forex trading. The execution is fast, the charting tools are professional-grade, and there is built-in market sentiment data showing what percentage of XTB traders are long or short on each pair. These are tools that active forex traders genuinely use.</p>

        <p>eToro&#x27;s forex offering is adequate but clearly secondary to its social trading features. The spreads are wider, the charting is basic, and there are no advanced order types like trailing stops with server-side execution.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">If I were an active forex trader, I would use XTB over eToro without hesitation. The tighter spreads and better platform make a real difference when you are making frequent trades. But I am a copy trader, not a day trader &mdash; so the forex comparison does not change my personal choice.</p>

        <!-- ==================== COPY TRADING ==================== -->

        <h2 id="copy-trading">Copy Trading: The Missing Feature</h2>

        <p>XTB does not offer copy trading. There is no way to automatically mirror another trader&#x27;s positions on the platform. XTB has been developing community features, but as of now, there is nothing comparable to eToro&#x27;s CopyTrader.</p>

        <p>eToro&#x27;s <a href="../copy-trading.html">CopyTrader</a> remains unique among major regulated brokers. You allocate a minimum of $200 to copy a trader, and every trade they make is automatically replicated in your portfolio proportionally. After nearly 10 years of using it, it continues to be the primary reason I stay on eToro.</p>

        <p>If copy trading is your reason for investing, this comparison is decided before it starts. XTB is not an option.</p>

        <!-- ==================== CRYPTO ==================== -->

        <h2 id="crypto">Crypto: eToro&#x27;s Territory</h2>

        <p>eToro offers <strong>80+ cryptocurrencies with real ownership</strong>. You buy actual Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other coins. You can transfer them to the eToro Money crypto wallet. This is genuine crypto investing.</p>

        <p>XTB offers <strong>crypto CFDs only</strong> in most regions. You are trading the price movement, not owning the underlying asset. You cannot withdraw or transfer crypto from XTB &mdash; it is purely a speculative trading instrument.</p>

        <p>For anyone who wants to actually own and hold cryptocurrency, eToro wins decisively. XTB&#x27;s crypto CFDs are suitable for short-term trading, but not for buy-and-hold crypto investors.</p>

        <!-- ==================== EDUCATION ==================== -->

        <h2 id="education">Education &amp; Research</h2>

        <p>Both platforms have strong educational offerings, but with different approaches.</p>

        <p><strong>XTB Academy</strong> is comprehensive and well-structured. It includes video courses, articles, webinars, and a clear learning path from beginner to advanced. XTB&#x27;s educational content is particularly strong on technical analysis and forex trading strategies. The built-in market analysis within xStation 5 &mdash; including daily market commentary and economic calendar &mdash; is excellent.</p>

        <p><strong>eToro</strong> has its own educational content, but its real strength is learning by doing &mdash; the social feed exposes you to other investors&#x27; reasoning, and copy trading lets you learn from experienced traders&#x27; actual decisions. eToro&#x27;s academy covers the basics well but is less comprehensive than XTB&#x27;s for active trading skills.</p>

        <p>For structured education on trading techniques, XTB has the edge. For learning through social observation and copy trading, eToro&#x27;s approach is unique.</p>

        <!-- ==================== REGULATION ==================== -->

        <h2 id="regulation">Regulation &amp; Safety</h2>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Factor</th><th>XTB</th><th>eToro</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td><strong>Primary Regulators</strong></td><td>FCA (UK), KNF (Poland)</td><td>FCA (UK), CySEC (Cyprus)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Additional</strong></td><td>CySEC, IFSC, DFSA, FSCA</td><td>ASIC (Australia), FinCEN (US)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Public Company</strong></td><td>Yes (Warsaw Stock Exchange)</td><td>No (private)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Investor Protection (UK)</strong></td><td>FSCS up to &pound;85,000</td><td>FSCS up to &pound;85,000</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Negative Balance Protection</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Client Fund Segregation</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Both are well-regulated with FCA oversight and FSCS protection for UK investors. XTB has the added transparency of being a publicly traded company. eToro has broader geographic reach with ASIC and US regulation. Neither raises any red flags on safety.</p>

        <!-- ==================== WHO SHOULD CHOOSE ==================== -->

        <h2 id="who-should-choose">Who Should Choose XTB?</h2>

        <!-- ==================== VERDICT ==================== -->

        <h2 id="verdict">Final Verdict</h2>

        <p>eToro and XTB are both excellent platforms that happen to excel in different areas. XTB is the better <em>trading</em> platform &mdash; superior charting, tighter forex spreads, a cleaner execution experience, and competitive costs. If you are an active, self-directed trader, XTB deserves serious consideration.</p>

        <p>eToro is the better <em>social investing</em> platform &mdash; copy trading, real crypto, a community of investors, and an experience designed for accessibility. If copy trading matters to you, eToro remains the only serious option among regulated brokers.</p>

        <p>There is no wrong choice here. The right platform depends on how you invest, not on which platform is objectively &ldquo;better.&rdquo;</p>
