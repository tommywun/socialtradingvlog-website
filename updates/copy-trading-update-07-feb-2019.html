        <p>February 7, 2019 Social Trading Vlog It's been a tough week with one of my traders hitting their Stop Loss, and me having to manually close another...</p>
        <p>Here's my profile on Etoro: https://etoro.tw/2rcYYm0</p>
        <p>Copy Trading does not amount to investment advice. The value of your investments may go up or down. Your capital is at risk.</p>
        <p>All trading involves risk. Only risk capital you’re prepared to lose. Past performance is not an indication of future results. This content is for educational purposes only and is not investment advice.</p>
        <h2>A Copy Stop Loss Triggered...</h2>
        <p>The trader 'Dazpanda' has been dropped from my portfolio! He actually triggered my copy stop loss, which is afeature designed to automatically stop your copy of a trader if they ever lose a pre-defined amount of money. When I saw that the Copy Stop Loss had been triggered, I felt like I was missing out, but, on the whole, it's a good thing, as it's in line with my risk management ideas.</p>
        <p>Another trader, 'Manusabrina' has also gone from the portfolio, although I stopped that copy manually as their risk score was also too high, and I really want a more stable postfolio.</p>
        <h3>What I did next</h3>
        <p>After that I copied and then un-copied 'Berrau' and 'Harshsmith' - it was a bit of panic as i just wanted to re-use the money from the stopped Dazpanda and Manusabrina copies as fast as possible. Panic's never good though, so I just re-invested the funds in my existing traders and will take some time to think about who to copy next.</p>
        <p>I go over the other traders in the portfolio, talking about Aimstrader's current problems, and why I'm waiting and seeing what will happen.</p>
        <h3>Statistics Issues</h3>
        <p>I've been hearing people having issues and concerns about the statistics on Etoro and there's been a lot of confusion about which stats are right and why there are certain contradictions and differing results. To be honest, I'm still not sure what's going on, but I'm now tallying up / comparing the normal trading stats chart with the closed trades in the 'history' section of the portfolio. I'm also then trying to cross reference that with the chart for each trader to try to get a full picture. I'll let you know how it goes.</p>
        <p>I'm also looking for a good low-risk commodities trader, so if you know of one, please let me know!</p>
