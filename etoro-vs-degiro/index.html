          <strong>Risk Warning</strong>
          eToro is a multi-asset investment platform. The value of your investments may go up or down. 51% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with eToro. You should consider whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money. This content is for educational and informational purposes only &mdash; it is not investment advice.

        </div>

        <!-- ==================== OVERVIEW ==================== -->

        <h2 id="overview">Overview of Both Platforms</h2>

        <p><strong>eToro</strong> was founded in 2007 and has grown to over 35 million users globally. It is regulated by the FCA (UK), CySEC (Cyprus), ASIC (Australia), and FinCEN (US). eToro is best known for its <strong>CopyTrader</strong> feature &mdash; the ability to automatically mirror the trades of other investors. It offers real stocks, ETFs, CFDs across multiple asset classes, and 80+ cryptocurrencies with real ownership.</p>

        <p><strong>DEGIRO</strong> was founded in the Netherlands in 2013 and merged with flatexDEGIRO AG in 2020, making it part of a publicly traded German financial group listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. It is regulated by BaFin (Germany) and the AFM (Netherlands) under MiFID II. DEGIRO provides direct market access to <strong>50+ stock exchanges worldwide</strong> and offers stocks, ETFs, bonds, options, futures, and warrants. It does not offer CFDs, forex, or crypto.</p>

        <p>These platforms serve fundamentally different types of investor. Understanding that difference is the key to choosing between them.</p>

        <!-- ==================== FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE ==================== -->

        <h2 id="fundamental-difference">The Fundamental Difference</h2>

        <p>eToro is a <strong>social trading platform</strong>. Its core value proposition is community and copy trading. You browse other investors, analyse their performance, and copy the ones you trust. The social feed, Popular Investor programme, and Smart Portfolios all revolve around this social ecosystem. You can also trade independently, but the platform is designed around the social experience.</p>

        <p>DEGIRO is a <strong>traditional discount brokerage</strong>. There is no social feed, no copy trading, no community features. You research your own investments, place your own trades, and manage your own portfolio. DEGIRO&#x27;s value proposition is <strong>low-cost access to the widest possible range of global markets</strong>.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">I think of it this way &mdash; eToro is where I go to copy experienced traders and benefit from their decisions. If I wanted to build a global stock portfolio myself, picking individual shares across different exchanges, DEGIRO would be the tool for that job. They are not competing for the same user.</p>

        <!-- ==================== FEES ==================== -->

        <h2 id="fees-comparison">Fees Compared</h2>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Fee Type</th><th>DEGIRO</th><th>eToro</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td><strong>US Stock Commission</strong></td><td>$0</td><td>$0</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>European Stocks</strong></td><td>$0 on major exchanges</td><td>$0 (but FX conversion applies)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>ETFs</strong></td><td>Core selection free; others may have small fees</td><td>$0</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Handling Fee</strong></td><td>&euro;1.00 on some external exchanges</td><td>N/A</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Withdrawal Fee</strong></td><td>$0</td><td>$5</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Inactivity Fee</strong></td><td>$0</td><td>$10/month after 12 months</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Currency Conversion</strong></td><td>0.25% (AutoFX)</td><td>0.5% (50 pips)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Options</strong></td><td>&euro;0.75 per contract</td><td>Not available</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Futures</strong></td><td>&euro;0.75 per contract</td><td>Not available</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>CFDs / Forex</strong></td><td>Not available</td><td>Spread-based</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>On pure cost, DEGIRO wins in most categories. No withdrawal fee, no inactivity fee, and significantly lower currency conversion (0.25% vs 0.5%). For a non-USD investor putting &pound;10,000 into US stocks, the conversion cost difference alone is &pound;25 &mdash; DEGIRO costs &pound;25 in conversion, eToro costs &pound;50.</p>

        <p>Where eToro&#x27;s fees make sense is when you factor in the features. Copy trading, crypto, and CFD access are included in eToro&#x27;s cost structure. DEGIRO simply does not offer these. You are comparing the cost of two different products.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">If all you want is to buy and hold stocks, DEGIRO is objectively cheaper. But if you want copy trading, you would need to pay for both DEGIRO <em>and</em> a separate copy trading service &mdash; which does not really exist at DEGIRO&#x27;s price point. eToro bundles it all together.</p>

        <!-- ==================== AVAILABLE MARKETS ==================== -->

        <h2 id="available-markets">Available Markets &amp; Exchanges</h2>

        <p>This is DEGIRO&#x27;s knockout advantage. DEGIRO provides <strong>direct market access to 50+ stock exchanges</strong> across Europe, North America, Asia-Pacific, and beyond. You can buy shares directly on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Australian Securities Exchange, multiple European exchanges (XETRA, Euronext Amsterdam, London Stock Exchange, Borsa Italiana), and many more.</p>

        <p>eToro offers around <strong>5,000+ instruments across approximately 17 exchanges</strong>. For most casual investors, this is plenty. But if you want to invest in a specific Japanese small-cap stock, or a Scandinavian company listed only on the Stockholm exchange, DEGIRO is the one that gives you access.</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Category</th><th>DEGIRO</th><th>eToro</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td><strong>Stock Exchanges</strong></td><td>50+</td><td>~17</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Countries</strong></td><td>30+</td><td>~15</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Total Instruments</strong></td><td>Tens of thousands</td><td>5,000+</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>ETFs</strong></td><td>Massive selection</td><td>Good selection</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Bonds</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Warrants</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>For the average investor buying Apple, Tesla, or a global ETF, both platforms work fine. DEGIRO&#x27;s advantage shows when you need breadth and depth of market access.</p>

        <!-- ==================== OPTIONS & FUTURES ==================== -->

        <h2 id="options-futures">Options &amp; Futures: DEGIRO&#x27;s Exclusive</h2>

        <p>DEGIRO offers real <strong>options trading</strong> at &euro;0.75 per contract and <strong>futures trading</strong> at the same rate. These are genuine listed derivatives on European exchanges &mdash; not the synthetic CFD products that some platforms offer.</p>

        <p>eToro does not offer options or futures trading at all. If derivatives are part of your investment strategy, DEGIRO (or Interactive Brokers) is where you need to be.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">I do not personally trade options or futures, so this is not something that draws me to DEGIRO. But I know from my YouTube audience that this is a significant factor for more experienced investors. If you need these instruments, the choice is straightforward.</p>

        <!-- ==================== COPY TRADING ==================== -->

        <h2 id="copy-trading">Copy Trading: eToro&#x27;s Exclusive</h2>

        <p>DEGIRO has absolutely no copy trading, social trading, or any community features. There is no way to see what other investors are doing, no way to automatically mirror anyone&#x27;s trades, and no social feed.</p>

        <p>eToro&#x27;s <a href="../copy-trading.html">CopyTrader</a> is a genuinely unique feature in the regulated brokerage space. You allocate a minimum of $200 to copy a trader, and every trade they make is automatically replicated in your account proportionally. After nearly 10 years of using it, I can say it works as advertised &mdash; though <a href="../best-traders-to-copy-etoro/">choosing the right traders</a> is where the real skill lies.</p>

        <p>If copy trading is your primary reason for investing, this comparison is already decided. DEGIRO is not even in the conversation.</p>

        <!-- ==================== CRYPTO ==================== -->

        <h2 id="crypto">Crypto: eToro Only</h2>

        <p>DEGIRO does not offer cryptocurrency trading of any kind. No real crypto, no crypto CFDs, nothing. If you want crypto exposure through DEGIRO, your only option is buying a crypto ETF or ETP &mdash; an indirect investment vehicle that tracks crypto prices.</p>

        <p>eToro offers <strong>80+ cryptocurrencies with real ownership</strong>. You can buy, hold, and transfer Bitcoin, Ethereum, and dozens of altcoins. This is genuine crypto ownership, not a CFD or derivative.</p>

        <p>For investors who want a single platform covering stocks, ETFs, and crypto, eToro is the obvious choice. DEGIRO does not pretend to be a crypto platform.</p>

        <!-- ==================== PLATFORM EXPERIENCE ==================== -->

        <h2 id="platform-experience">Platform &amp; User Experience</h2>

        <p>eToro&#x27;s interface is designed for accessibility. The social feed, copy trading features, and clean design make it approachable for people who have never invested before. The mobile app is polished and the web platform is intuitive.</p>

        <p>DEGIRO&#x27;s interface is functional but more utilitarian. It is not ugly, but it is clearly designed for people who know what they are looking for. There is less hand-holding, fewer educational prompts, and a more traditional brokerage feel. The mobile app works well but lacks the visual polish of eToro&#x27;s.</p>

        <p>For beginners, eToro is the friendlier experience. For experienced investors who just want to place a trade quickly without social features, DEGIRO gets out of your way more effectively.</p>

        <!-- ==================== REGULATION ==================== -->

        <h2 id="regulation">Regulation &amp; Safety</h2>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Factor</th><th>DEGIRO</th><th>eToro</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td><strong>Primary Regulators</strong></td><td>BaFin (Germany), AFM (Netherlands)</td><td>FCA (UK), CySEC (Cyprus)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Additional Regulation</strong></td><td>MiFID II across EU</td><td>ASIC (Australia), FinCEN (US)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Parent Company</strong></td><td>flatexDEGIRO AG (Frankfurt Stock Exchange listed)</td><td>Private (attempted SPAC IPO)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Investor Protection</strong></td><td>German banking licence; up to &euro;100,000 deposit guarantee</td><td>FSCS up to &pound;85,000 (UK), ICF up to &euro;20,000 (EU)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Client Fund Segregation</strong></td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Both platforms are well-regulated. DEGIRO benefits from German banking infrastructure through its parent company flatexDEGIRO, which provides arguably stronger financial backing. eToro has broader geographic regulation through ASIC and US entities. Both segregate client funds.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">I feel equally safe with both platforms. DEGIRO being part of a publicly traded German financial group is reassuring. eToro being FCA-regulated with FSCS protection gives me confidence as a UK investor. Neither keeps me awake at night.</p>

        <!-- ==================== WHO IS IT FOR ==================== -->

        <h2 id="who-is-it-for">Which One Is Right for You?</h2>

        <p><strong>Choose eToro if you:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Want copy trading &mdash; the ability to automatically mirror other investors</li>
          <li>Are a beginner who wants a friendly, guided experience</li>
          <li>Want to trade crypto alongside stocks</li>
          <li>Want CFD access for forex, commodities, or leveraged positions</li>
          <li>Value the social community and investor feed</li>
          <li>Want everything on one platform with a simple interface</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Choose DEGIRO if you:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Are a self-directed investor who does their own research</li>
          <li>Want access to 50+ global stock exchanges</li>
          <li>Need options, futures, or bond trading</li>
          <li>Want the lowest possible fees, especially currency conversion</li>
          <li>Do not need or want social features or copy trading</li>
          <li>Are a European investor focused on building a diversified stock portfolio</li>
          <li>Value the backing of a German-regulated banking group</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- ==================== VERDICT ==================== -->

        <h2 id="verdict">Final Verdict</h2>

        <p>This is not a case of one platform being better than the other. eToro and DEGIRO serve genuinely different investors with minimal overlap.</p>

        <p>If copy trading, crypto, and a social investing experience are important to you, eToro is the clear choice. DEGIRO does not even attempt to compete in this space.</p>

        <p>If you are a self-directed investor who wants the widest possible access to global markets at the lowest cost, with options and futures available, DEGIRO is superior. eToro cannot match DEGIRO&#x27;s exchange coverage or fee structure for pure stock investing.</p>

        <p>Personally, I use eToro because copy trading is central to my investing approach &mdash; it is what I have been documenting for nearly 10 years on YouTube. But I respect DEGIRO as a platform and understand exactly why serious buy-and-hold investors prefer it.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">I should be clear &mdash; I am not a financial adviser and this is not a recommendation to use either platform. I use eToro myself and have done for nearly a decade, but that reflects my personal investing style. I have no affiliation with DEGIRO. Please do your own research before investing.</p>
