        <h2 id="what-is-etoro">What Is eToro?</h2>
        <p>eToro&#x27;s a site which aims itself squarely at the retail investor market — that&#x27;s you and me, the financially untrained civilian, hoping to have a go at the markets and maybe make some of these profits we see people online or on TV making.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s a strange and seemingly complicated world — investing, trading, forex — what does it all mean? eToro&#x27;s goal was really to make it accessible (whilst also making a tidy profit itself!). So how&#x27;s it done?</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s done extremely well. As well as standard investing and trading features where you can buy and sell assets yourself, their innovative &#x27;copy trading&#x27; feature is perhaps the real draw — allowing users with little or no experience to browse the profile and stats of other users and simply set their account to copy that user&#x27;s trades. It&#x27;s a very smart idea, made possible because we all got used to social media and things are made to look so simple and clean that pretty much anyone can work out the general idea. But it&#x27;s still live markets. It&#x27;s still super risky. It&#x27;s still real money we&#x27;re all using here — although there is a demo account to get familiar with how it works without risking real money.</p>
        <p>It was founded in 2007 and is regulated by the FCA in the UK and CySEC in the EU. It&#x27;s a well-known, massive brand — leaders in the space, doing flashy high-profile things like sponsoring football teams. After 8 years using the site, I think I can fairly say they&#x27;re not here to scam people out of a quick buck. Their business is worth billions and I doubt they&#x27;re about to jeopardise that doing obviously scammy things.</p>
        <p>There are loads of different types of assets you can trade or invest in — real stocks and ETFs, CFDs on forex and commodities (a synthetic asset tied exactly to the price of another asset — we&#x27;ll get to that later), crypto, and more. There&#x27;s a lot there, and they keep adding to it.</p>
        <p class="toms-note">I&#x27;m just an amateur though, and please don&#x27;t take this as any sort of financial advice, I mean that — I came here to find a way to invest where I didn&#x27;t have to do the work myself... Over time I&#x27;ve got familiar with the landscape and eToro&#x27;s been really useful in introducing me to it all, but I&#x27;m still no pro!</p>
        <h2 id="first-impressions">First Impressions and Ease of Use</h2>
        <p>eToro&#x27;s interface is genuinely clean and beginner-friendly. The mobile app&#x27;s also incredibly clean and useable — you can find a trader, check their stats, and start copying them in a few taps. That accessibility is a double-edged sword: it makes investing feel easy, which can lead beginners to underestimate the risk.</p>
        <p>The social feed — where traders post updates, trade ideas, and news commentary — is either useful or noisy depending on how you approach it. I mostly ignore it. The people worth copying are rarely the loudest voices in the feed.</p>
        <p>Having said that, eToro have gone to great lengths to get their Popular Investors communicating with the people copying them, so you&#x27;ll see regular updates from the PIs you&#x27;re copying in your feed. They really did a big push a few years ago to make sure none of the people we copy just go silent when times are tough — or just in general. That side of it I do appreciate, it&#x27;s reassuring to hear from the people you&#x27;re following even when markets are rough.</p>
        <p>One frustration: eToro&#x27;s customer support has historically been slow. Waiting 48–72 hours for a reply used to be common. That&#x27;s improved somewhat in recent years, but it&#x27;s still not the fastest. If you have an urgent account issue, expect to be patient.</p>
        <h2 id="copy-trading-experience">Copy Trading — What It&#x27;s Actually Like</h2>
        <p>Copy trading on eToro is the real selling point. You allocate money to a trader, and every trade they make is proportionally mirrored in your account automatically. If they put 5% of their portfolio into Apple, 5% of your copy amount goes into Apple too.</p>
        <p>The key to making copy trading work is patience and selectivity. Most people start by copying someone with impressive recent returns — big mistake. A trader up 200% in a year is almost always taking on enormous risk. The traders worth copying long-term tend to have steady annual returns of 15–30%, consistent risk scores, and multi-year track records.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;ve had some really rough experiences with traders who initially looked great... &quot;Wow, look at this guy!&quot; you think, and jump on that &#x27;copy&#x27; button in hope of those massive gains. But I&#x27;ve watched them soar and then blow their whole account in days with a series of incredibly risky moves, chasing losses or whatever classic mistake people make when under pressure and hoping not to lose. It&#x27;s been a real lesson in how to try to spot the actual good ones.</p>
        <p class="toms-note">Honestly, my early trader choices were pretty bad — I just picked whoever had the biggest recent gains. I&#x27;ve learned a lot since then, but I want to be clear: I&#x27;m not an expert, just someone who&#x27;s made a lot of the mistakes already. Please don&#x27;t treat anything here as professional advice.</p>
        <p>Over time, I started to look for consistency above almost everything else. Can I see a clear trading history of over two years? If I look at their chart page — it&#x27;s easy to find — can I see huge volatile downward spikes? Or is there a stability to their growth, and even to their losses? How are their risk scores? Again, easy to see. I&#x27;ve found that the crowd does tend to identify the talented ones, although a lot of people still pick the high-risk ones and take their chances.</p>
        <p>You get more familiar with all this over time — what&#x27;s a &#x27;copy stop loss&#x27;, what&#x27;s a &#x27;risk score&#x27;, which types of assets are inherently riskier than others. The beauty of copy trading is that you don&#x27;t actually need to know any of this — you just need to pick a trader, copy them, and that&#x27;s it. Whatever they do, you do. But over time I found myself wanting to understand what these terms meant, and whilst copying, it felt like a safer way to learn whilst someone — hopefully more experienced! — was making the actual decisions.</p>
        <p>Smart Portfolios are worth considering if you don&#x27;t want to pick individual traders. These are thematic, managed portfolios (tech stocks, crypto baskets, etc.) that eToro curates. They&#x27;re less hands-on than copy trading and can be a sensible starting point — but they can have expensive buy-ins, and for that reason I don&#x27;t have much personal experience with them. eToro does change things from time to time and add offers on these thematic portfolios, so it&#x27;s worth keeping an eye on any special deals they might be promoting.</p>
        <h2 id="fees">eToro Fees — What You Actually Pay</h2>
        <p>eToro brought stock trading commissions back in early 2025. For a period they&#x27;d scrapped them entirely — a zero-commission model they used to attract a huge wave of new users — but in 2025 they quietly reintroduced them, albeit in a limited form. For most exchanges it&#x27;s $1 per trade, charged both when you open and when you close a position. For Australian, Hong Kong, Dubai and Abu Dhabi exchanges it&#x27;s $2. Not a dealbreaker, but it&#x27;s no longer the zero-commission platform it spent years marketing itself as.</p>
        <p>ETFs are still commission-free, which is a genuine plus. And if you&#x27;re copy trading or using Smart Portfolios, stock commissions don&#x27;t apply on opening — so the core copy trading experience remains cost-effective.</p>
        <p>CFDs — most often when you&#x27;re opening leveraged positions (a sort of multiplier effect), short selling, or forex. If you don&#x27;t know what these are don&#x27;t worry, there&#x27;s a lot of names and jargon, but you&#x27;ll get used to it all over time — in the meantime there&#x27;s copy trading! — carry a spread plus an overnight fee for every night you hold the position open.</p>
        <p>They can really rack up over time, so it&#x27;s a genuine factor to consider before opening a CFD trade. Whenever you open a new trade manually, you&#x27;ll see the overnight fees outlined at the bottom of the open trade dialogue — and it changes depending on whether you&#x27;re using leverage etc. When copy trading, you&#x27;re still charged fees, but they&#x27;re something the person you&#x27;re copying is taking into account when projecting how profitable the trade might be overall.</p>
        <p>Crypto trading costs 1% to open and 1% to close. That&#x27;s transparent at least. Dedicated crypto exchanges are cheaper if you&#x27;re trading volume, but for occasional buys it&#x27;s acceptable.</p>
        <p>Withdrawal is a flat $5 if you&#x27;re on a USD account. If you&#x27;ve got a local currency account — GBP, EUR, AUD and DKK are available depending on where you live — withdrawals are free. There&#x27;s also a $10/month inactivity fee after 12 consecutive months of no logins, which is easy enough to avoid.</p>
        <p class="toms-note">I&#x27;m not a financial adviser — this is just my honest summary of what eToro currently charges, based on their official fees page as of early 2026. Fees do change, so always check etoro.com/trading/fees directly before making any decisions.</p>
        <h2 id="etoro-club">eToro Club — What You Get as Your Balance Grows</h2>
        <p>eToro has a tiered membership programme called eToro Club. You join automatically based on your account balance — no application needed. The tiers are Silver ($5,000), Gold ($10,000), Platinum ($25,000), Platinum+ ($50,000) and Diamond ($250,000). Platinum is also available as a subscription for £4.99/month if you don&#x27;t yet have the balance.</p>
        <p>The main perks are discounts on currency conversion fees, a revenue share on crypto staking (ranging from 55% at Silver to 90% at Diamond), and cashback on crypto trading fees. Diamond members get a full FX conversion fee exemption, which can be meaningful if you&#x27;re regularly depositing in GBP or EUR and trading USD-denominated assets.</p>
        <p>Higher tiers also come with a dedicated account manager, WhatsApp support, and insurance through Lloyd&#x27;s of London for up to $1 million. There&#x27;s interest paid on USD cash balances too — the rate varies by tier and by region.</p>
        <p>For most casual copy traders, Silver or Gold is where you&#x27;ll naturally land if your portfolio grows, and the day-to-day fee difference at those levels is modest. The bigger perks really only kick in at Platinum+ and Diamond.</p>
        <p class="toms-note">I&#x27;m not anywhere near Diamond tier. But it&#x27;s worth knowing these discounts exist as a balance grows, because the conversion fees in particular can add up if you&#x27;re depositing regularly in GBP.</p>
        <h2 id="who-its-for">Who eToro Is Right For</h2>
        <p>I came to eToro looking for an easy way to be involved with investing. I&#x27;m not a trader, but I&#x27;d always seen it growing up. I think they pretty much aimed the site at people like me — it&#x27;s slickly presented (sometimes it can be so slick and beautiful it almost lulls me into a false sense of security) and easy to use. I love the way I can browse people&#x27;s profiles, see their stats, and choose whether I want to copy them — it still strikes me as genius. It&#x27;s just very well done.</p>
        <p>I haven&#x27;t found another site which does it better yet, so for me, who wants a passive way to be involved, it&#x27;s great. I can set my account to copy whoever I want and then go and get on with my life. For people wanting to trade manually, there&#x27;s loads of asset types and it&#x27;s all very cleanly laid out. The user interface really is great.</p>
        <h3>Is it too pricey?</h3>
        <p>In terms of fees, things change constantly, so check around and see what&#x27;s best for you. I think it depends on volume of trades. From what I hear, eToro is less suited to active traders who need tight spreads, fast execution, and advanced charting — the spread fees (the amount you pay when you open and close a new trade) can at times be higher than on some other platforms designed for pro traders doing high volume. Many popular investors on eToro do trade very actively though, and they seem to still be very profitable. Same with crypto — you can trade loads of them on eToro, but dedicated crypto exchanges seem to offer more attractive spreads and fees.</p>
        <p>That said, my first exposure to crypto was on eToro, it&#x27;s added more and more over time, and there are very active crypto investors on there.</p>
        <p>What&#x27;s been really important for me has been the educational aspect of it all. I was able to copy trade — let my account automatically copy someone more experienced than myself. It gave me the freedom to wander around reading and watching, getting mildly obsessed with all sorts of videos about finance. I wanted to learn what they were talking about, and being exposed to the markets really lights a fire under you to know a little about what&#x27;s going on. As soon as you have some skin in the game there&#x27;s a much greater motivation.</p>
        <p>So, for me, eToro was my sort of doorway into the world of investing — copying other traders automatically gave me the exposure to the markets I wanted without the stress of trying to do it all blindly myself.</p>
        <p>In the beginning, I did try some manual trades and soon learned how easy it is to lose money by using the magic &#x27;leverage&#x27; button when you have no idea what you&#x27;re doing. So I could then step back, stop trying to do it myself, copy trade and learn more slowly. It&#x27;s been really useful in that way.</p>
        <p>It&#x27;s not a perfect site. It&#x27;s centralised, the spread fees can be too high at times, and I wish there were slightly better ways to filter the people I&#x27;d like to copy. But it keeps improving, there&#x27;s nothing out there which beats it so far from what I can see, and it&#x27;s been a joy to use for these years.</p>
        <p>My withdrawals have always been processed quickly, I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with that, and things have worked well. I&#x27;d recommend it — but do remember this isn&#x27;t a game. It looks so attractive and clean that it&#x27;s good to keep in mind that if you&#x27;re looking for a thrill, you&#x27;re likely to lose money. The ones who make it expect slow growth, a purposeful lack of thrills, and hopefully see their account compound over time.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;d also recommend a little caution when picking the traders you&#x27;re going to copy. Flashy fast results are attractive, but I&#x27;ve found that looking for traders with historical data, stable risk scores, and perhaps more modest returns has caused me far fewer jangled nerves and headaches over time. I&#x27;ve learned! Slowly, but I&#x27;ve learned :)</p>
        <p class="toms-note">I am not a financial adviser, I don&#x27;t have any professional qualifications in this area, and nothing on this site is financial advice. I&#x27;m just a regular person who&#x27;s been using eToro for a while and wanted to share my experience honestly. If you&#x27;re making big financial decisions, please talk to a qualified professional.</p>
