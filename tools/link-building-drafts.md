## QUORA ANSWERS (Top 10 opportunities)

### 1. "Is eToro a scam or a legitimate trading website?"
**URL**: https://www.quora.com/Is-eToro-a-scam-or-a-legitimate-trading-website
**Target link**: socialtradingvlog.com/etoro-review/
**Why**: Huge traffic question, most answers are either shills or rants. A balanced real-experience answer stands out.

**Draft answer:**

I've been using eToro since 2017, so I've got about 9 years of real experience with the platform at this point. Short answer: it's not a scam, but it's not perfect either.

eToro is regulated by the FCA (UK), CySEC (Cyprus), and ASIC (Australia). Your money is held in segregated accounts. I've deposited and withdrawn money many times over the years without issues. So from a legitimacy standpoint, it's solid.

Where people get burned is the fees and the way copy trading works. The spreads are wider than dedicated stock brokers, there are overnight fees on leveraged positions that can eat into profits, and a lot of beginners jump in copying traders without understanding the risks involved.

I've documented my entire journey — the wins AND the losses — on my YouTube channel (Social Trading Vlog, 335 videos over 6+ years) and I wrote a detailed honest review covering everything I've learned: https://socialtradingvlog.com/etoro-review/

The 76% retail investor loss statistic that eToro publishes is real, and I wrote about why that happens here: https://socialtradingvlog.com/video/why-do-most-etoro-traders-lose-money/

It's a legitimate platform, but you need to go in with realistic expectations and understand how the fees work.

### 2. "Why do people lose money on eToro?"
**URL**: https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-lose-money-on-eToro
**Target link**: socialtradingvlog.com/video/why-do-most-etoro-traders-lose-money/
**Why**: Directly matches your best article. Existing answers are thin (just "leverage").

**Draft answer:**

I've been copy trading on eToro since 2017 and I've seen both sides of this. The official stat is that 76% of retail investor accounts lose money trading CFDs with eToro. Here's why, from what I've observed:

**1. Leverage.** Most beginners don't understand that when you trade CFDs, you're using leverage. A 2x leveraged position means a 10% drop wipes out 20% of your investment. Many people don't even realise they're trading CFDs rather than buying real assets.

**2. Copying the wrong traders.** People sort by "highest returns" and copy whoever's at the top. But high returns usually mean high risk. The traders showing 200% annual gains are often taking massive risks that will eventually blow up. I've learned this the hard way.

**3. Not understanding copy trading mechanics.** When you copy someone, you're not just investing — you're replicating their exact trades proportionally. If they go heavy into one position, so do you. If they use leverage, so do you (by default).

**4. Impatience.** People copy a trader, see a -5% dip after a week, panic, and stop the copy at a loss. Markets fluctuate. You need to give strategies time.

**5. Fees.** Overnight fees on leveraged positions compound over time. Many people don't factor these in.

I made a detailed video and article breaking down exactly why most eToro traders lose money and what you can do differently: https://socialtradingvlog.com/video/why-do-most-etoro-traders-lose-money/

I've also got a guide on how to choose traders to copy more carefully: https://socialtradingvlog.com/copy-trading.html

### 3. "Does copy trading really work for beginners?"
**URL**: https://www.quora.com/Does-copy-trading-really-work-for-beginners
**Target link**: socialtradingvlog.com/copy-trading.html
**Why**: High intent beginner question, existing answers are generic.

**Draft answer:**

It can, but it's not the easy passive income people think it is. I've been copy trading on eToro for about 9 years now and I've made real money, but I've also lost real money.

Here's what beginners get wrong:

**They think it's "set and forget."** It's not. You still need to check in, understand what your copied traders are doing, and be prepared to stop copies that aren't working.

**They don't diversify.** Copying one trader is like putting all your eggs in one basket. I copy multiple traders across different strategies and asset classes.

**They don't understand the risks.** Copy trading doesn't eliminate market risk. If markets crash, your portfolio crashes too — doesn't matter how good your copied trader is.

That said, copy trading IS a genuinely useful tool for beginners because you get to learn by watching experienced traders make real decisions. I learned more about trading by studying what my copied traders did than I ever learned from YouTube tutorials.

I wrote a full guide on what copy trading actually is and how to approach it sensibly: https://socialtradingvlog.com/copy-trading.html

### 4. "What is copy trading and what are its pros and cons?"
**URL**: https://www.quora.com/What-is-copy-trading-and-what-are-its-pros-and-cons
**Target link**: socialtradingvlog.com/copy-trading.html
**Why**: Evergreen educational question, links perfectly to your guide.

**Draft answer:**

Copy trading is where you automatically replicate another trader's positions in your own account. When they buy, you buy. When they sell, you sell. Your trades are proportional to how much you've allocated.

I've been doing this on eToro since 2017. Here are the real pros and cons from my experience:

**Pros:**
- You can invest without spending hours analysing markets yourself
- It's a genuinely useful learning tool — you see what experienced traders actually do
- You can diversify across multiple traders and strategies
- Lower barrier to entry than trying to trade on your own

**Cons:**
- It's NOT passive income — you still need to monitor and manage
- Past performance really doesn't guarantee future results (I've seen "star" traders blow up)
- Fees add up, especially overnight fees on leveraged positions
- You can't control individual trades — if your copied trader makes a bad call, you go down with them
- The psychology is tricky — watching your money go up and down based on someone else's decisions is stressful

The biggest misconception is that copy trading is easy money. It's easier than trading yourself, but it still requires research, patience, and realistic expectations.

I wrote a detailed guide covering all of this: https://socialtradingvlog.com/copy-trading.html

### 5. "How can you choose the right traders to follow in copy trading?"
**URL**: https://www.quora.com/How-can-you-choose-the-right-traders-to-follow-in-copy-trading
**Target link**: socialtradingvlog.com/copy-trading.html
**Why**: Directly actionable, your site has specific guidance.

**Draft answer:**

After 9 years of copy trading on eToro, here's what I actually look for:

**1. Consistency over returns.** Ignore the traders showing 300% in one year. Look for steady 10-20% annual returns over 2+ years. Consistency beats big numbers.

**2. Risk score.** On eToro this is shown as 1-10. I stick with traders in the 3-5 range. Above 6 and you're in rollercoaster territory.

**3. Maximum drawdown.** How much did they lose at their worst point? If their max drawdown is 40%, that means at some point their copiers saw 40% of their money evaporate. Can you stomach that?

**4. Trading history length.** At least 2 years of data. Anyone can have a lucky 6 months.

**5. What they actually trade.** Look at their portfolio. Are they diversified or all-in on one sector? Do they use leverage?

**6. Number of copiers and AUM.** Not because popular means good — but because traders with real money copying them have more to lose from reckless behaviour.

**7. Check their feed.** Good traders communicate with their copiers. Silent traders are a red flag.

I've reviewed individual traders on my YouTube channel (Social Trading Vlog) over the years, and I wrote a guide on the whole copy trading process here: https://socialtradingvlog.com/copy-trading.html

### 6. "What is the best explanation of eToro hidden fees?"
**URL**: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-explanation-of-eToro-hidden-fees
**Target link**: socialtradingvlog.com/etoro-review/
**Why**: Fee transparency is a big concern, your review covers this.

**Draft answer:**

I've been on eToro for 9 years. The fees aren't exactly "hidden" — they're just not obvious unless you look.

Here's the breakdown:

**Spreads:** eToro doesn't charge commissions on stock trades, but they make money on the spread (the difference between buy and sell price). This is wider than traditional brokers.

**Overnight/weekend fees:** If you hold a CFD position (leveraged trade) overnight, you pay a daily fee. This is the one that catches most people out. Hold a leveraged position for months and these fees compound significantly.

**Withdrawal fee:** $5 per withdrawal. Not huge but annoying.

**Currency conversion fee:** If your base currency isn't USD, you pay a conversion fee on every deposit and withdrawal. This is one of the biggest hidden costs for non-US users.

**Inactivity fee:** $10/month if you don't log in for 12 months.

**The real "hidden" cost** is the spread + overnight fees on copy trading. When you copy a trader who uses leverage, you're paying overnight fees on those positions too. Over months, this eats into returns.

I cover all of this in my honest eToro review (9 years of real experience): https://socialtradingvlog.com/etoro-review/

### 7. "Is copy trading worth it?"
**URL**: https://www.quora.com/Is-copy-trading-worth-it
**Target link**: socialtradingvlog.com/copy-trading-returns.html
**Why**: Zero answers currently! This is a gold mine.

**Draft answer:**

I've been copy trading on eToro since 2017, so I'll give you a straight answer based on real experience.

**Is it worth it? For me, yes — but with caveats.**

Over 9 years I've had years where my portfolio grew 20-30%, and years where it dropped. The key thing I've learned is that copy trading is NOT a get-rich-quick scheme. It's more like a slightly more accessible way to invest in markets if you don't have the time or expertise to trade yourself.

**When it's worth it:**
- You want market exposure without doing all the analysis yourself
- You're patient (think years, not weeks)
- You diversify across multiple traders
- You understand you can still lose money

**When it's NOT worth it:**
- You're expecting guaranteed returns
- You can't handle seeing your portfolio drop 15-20% in a bad month
- You're not willing to research which traders to copy
- You're investing money you can't afford to lose

I've written about realistic return expectations here: https://socialtradingvlog.com/copy-trading-returns.html

And I've been documenting my real results (the good, the bad, and the ugly) on YouTube for 6+ years: youtube.com/socialtrading

### 8. "How do I start copy trading step by step?"
**URL**: https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-start-copy-trading-step-by-step
**Target link**: socialtradingvlog.com/copy-trading.html
**Why**: High intent, people ready to start.

**Draft answer:**

Here's how I'd approach it if I were starting today (I've been doing this since 2017 on eToro):

**Step 1: Start with the virtual portfolio.** eToro gives you $100,000 of virtual money to practise with. Use it. Copy a few traders, watch how it works, understand the mechanics before risking real money.

**Step 2: Only invest what you can afford to lose.** Seriously. Markets go down as well as up.

**Step 3: Research traders carefully.** Don't just sort by highest returns. Look at risk score, max drawdown, how long they've been trading, and what assets they trade. I explain exactly how to evaluate traders here: https://socialtradingvlog.com/copy-trading.html

**Step 4: Diversify.** Copy at least 3-5 traders with different strategies. I personally copy traders across different asset classes.

**Step 5: Set a stop loss.** You can set a maximum loss percentage on each copy. I'd suggest starting with a -40% to -50% stop loss so one bad trader can't wipe you out.

**Step 6: Be patient.** Don't check it every hour. Don't panic-sell after a bad week. Give your strategy at least 3-6 months.

**Step 7: Learn as you go.** The best thing about copy trading is you can watch what experienced traders do and learn from their decisions.

### 9. "How does eToro make money? Other than spread fees?"
**URL**: https://www.quora.com/How-does-eToro-make-money-Other-than-spread-fees-are-there-any-other-ways-of-them-making-money
**Target link**: socialtradingvlog.com/etoro-review/
**Why**: Shows expertise, links to your review.

**Draft answer:**

After 9 years on the platform, here's my understanding:

1. **Spreads** — the main revenue source. The gap between buy/sell prices on every trade.
2. **Overnight fees** — charged on CFD/leveraged positions held overnight. This is bigger than most people realise.
3. **Currency conversion** — eToro operates in USD. Every non-USD deposit/withdrawal incurs a conversion fee.
4. **Withdrawal fees** — $5 per withdrawal.
5. **Inactivity fees** — $10/month after 12 months of no activity.
6. **Payment for order flow** — like most brokers, they can earn from routing orders.
7. **Interest on uninvested cash** — they earn interest on client funds held in accounts.

The one that affects copy traders most is the overnight fee. If you're copying a trader who holds leveraged positions, you're paying these fees daily without necessarily realising it.

I break all this down in my detailed review: https://socialtradingvlog.com/etoro-review/

### 10. "Is Etoro legit and reliable? Has anybody become rich using Etoro?"
**URL**: https://www.quora.com/Is-Etoro-legit-and-reliable-Has-anybody-become-rich-using-Etoro
**Target link**: socialtradingvlog.com/etoro-review/
**Why**: High traffic question about legitimacy.

**Draft answer:**

Legit and reliable? Yes. It's regulated by the FCA, CySEC, and ASIC, and I've used it for 9 years without issues depositing or withdrawing.

Has anybody become rich? Probably some of the Popular Investors with millions under copy have done very well from the programme (eToro pays them based on assets under management). But for regular copy traders like me? "Rich" would be an exaggeration.

I've made decent returns over the years — some years better than others. Copy trading is more like a long-term investment strategy than a get-rich-quick scheme. Think "better than a savings account" rather than "quit your job" money.

The people who lose money are usually the ones who:
- Use too much leverage
- Copy high-risk traders expecting huge returns
- Don't diversify
- Panic sell at the worst time

I've been documenting my real experience (including the losses) on my YouTube channel for 6+ years and wrote an honest review here: https://socialtradingvlog.com/etoro-review/

## REDDIT STRATEGY

Reddit is trickier because many subreddits ban self-promotion. Here's the approach:

### Target subreddits:
- **r/etoro** (~15k members) — most relevant, but check rules
- **r/UKInvesting** — Tom's experience is UK/EU relevant
- **r/EuropeFIRE** — copy trading as part of FIRE strategy
- **r/trading** — general trading discussion
- **r/CopyTrading** — small but targeted

### Strategy:
1. **Build karma first** — comment helpfully on other posts for 2-3 weeks before linking
2. **Answer questions naturally** — when someone asks about eToro/copy trading, share real experience
3. **Link sparingly** — only link when it genuinely adds value, maybe 1 in 5 helpful comments
4. **Never use language like "check out my website"** — instead: "I wrote up my experience here: [link]"

### Draft Reddit comment template:
(For a thread asking about eToro copy trading experience)

> I've been copy trading on eToro since 2017 — about 9 years now. Happy to share what I've learned.
>
> The biggest thing is managing expectations. You're not going to retire off copy trading, but it can be a decent way to get market exposure without spending hours on analysis.
>
> My main tips: diversify across 3-5 traders, look at risk score and max drawdown (not just returns), use the virtual portfolio first, and be patient — think years, not weeks.
>
> I've documented my whole journey on YouTube (Social Trading Vlog) if you want to see real results over time.

Subject: Guest Post Pitch — Real Copy Trading Experience (9 Years)

Hi [Name],

I'm Tom, and I run SocialTradingVlog.com where I document my real experience with copy trading on eToro. I've been doing this for 9 years with over 335 YouTube videos showing my actual results.

I'd love to write a guest post for [Blog Name] about [topic]. Unlike most copy trading content online, mine is based on years of documented real experience — including the losses.

A few angles I could cover:
- What 9 years of copy trading actually taught me
- Why 76% of retail traders lose money (and how to avoid it)
- A beginner's realistic guide to copy trading
- Copy trading as passive income — myth vs reality

Happy to adapt to whatever fits your audience best. Let me know if you're interested!
