Remember, they’re actually trading with their own money – you’re just copying exactly what they’re doing."

To check if that’s happening, just go and look at their portfolio in their actual profile page and see what trades they currently have open. Then go to your own portfolio, and see your copy of them. Check that all the trades they have open, you’ve also got open via your copy. You can also check the ‘history’ section of their portfolio and your copy of them to see if you had all the past trades too… I’d watch that video I made about minimum trade sizes in copy trading to see what I mean.
