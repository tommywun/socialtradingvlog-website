          <strong>Risk Warning</strong>
          eToro is a multi-asset investment platform. The value of your investments may go up or down. 51% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with eToro. You should consider whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money. This content is for educational and informational purposes only — it is not investment advice.

        </div>

        <h2 id="overview">Overview of Both Platforms</h2>
        <p>eToro was founded in 2007 and is regulated by the FCA. It&#x27;s best known for its copy trading feature — CopyTrader — which lets you automatically mirror the trades of other investors. It offers real stocks and ETFs, CFDs, crypto, and managed portfolios (Smart Portfolios). It has over 30 million users globally.</p>
        <p>Trading 212 launched in the UK around 2016 and is also FCA regulated. It offers a Stocks &amp; Shares ISA, fractional shares, commission-free stock and ETF trading, and a cash interest account. It does not offer copy trading in the same sense as eToro — it lacks a CopyTrader-style feature.</p>
        <p>The fundamental difference: eToro is primarily a social investing and copy trading platform. Trading 212 is primarily a self-directed stock and ETF investing platform with a strong ISA offering. They cater to different investor types.</p>
        <h2 id="copy-trading-comparison">Copy Trading — No Contest</h2>
        <p>If copy trading is your primary reason for investing, eToro wins by a significant margin. Trading 212 offers a &#x27;Pies&#x27; feature where you can build and share portfolio templates — but this is not copy trading. There&#x27;s no live mirroring of another investor&#x27;s active trades.</p>
        <p>eToro&#x27;s CopyTrader gives you real-time, automatic mirroring of a live trader&#x27;s portfolio. When they buy, you buy. When they sell, you sell. This genuine automation is eToro&#x27;s key differentiator and the reason most copy traders use it.</p>
        <p>For someone who specifically wants to copy an experienced investor&#x27;s real-time decisions, Trading 212 simply doesn&#x27;t offer this. eToro is the only major regulated platform in the UK that does.</p>
        <h2 id="fees-comparison">Fees — Very Similar for Real Assets</h2>
        <p>Both platforms charge no commission on real stock and ETF trades. The cost is built into the spread — the difference between the buy and sell price.</p>
        <p>Trading 212 generally has tighter spreads on popular US stocks than eToro. This matters more for frequent traders than long-term investors, but it&#x27;s a real advantage for active stock traders.</p>
        <p>eToro charges a $5 withdrawal fee and a $10/month inactivity fee after 12 months. Trading 212 has no withdrawal fee and no inactivity fee — a meaningful advantage for occasional investors or those withdrawing frequently.</p>
        <p>For crypto, eToro charges around a 1% spread. Trading 212 also offers crypto with competitive spreads. Both are reasonable options for occasional crypto purchases.</p>
        <h2 id="isa">ISA — Trading 212 Wins</h2>
        <p>This is a significant difference for UK investors. Trading 212 offers a Stocks &amp; Shares ISA, allowing you to invest up to £20,000 per year with no capital gains tax or dividend tax on returns within the ISA wrapper.</p>
        <p>eToro does not currently offer a Stocks &amp; Shares ISA for UK investors. All eToro investing is done in a standard account, meaning gains above the CGT allowance are taxable.</p>
        <p>For long-term UK investors focused on stocks and ETFs, the ISA wrapper on Trading 212 is a meaningful advantage — particularly as gains accumulate over years. The tax saving can compound significantly.</p>
        <p class="toms-note">I should be clear — I&#x27;m not a financial adviser and this isn&#x27;t a recommendation to use either platform. I use eToro myself and I&#x27;ve found it works for me, but that&#x27;s based on my personal situation and investing style. Before putting real money anywhere, please do your own research and consider whether it&#x27;s right for you.</p>
        <h2 id="who-each-suits">Who Each Platform Is Right For</h2>
        <p>Choose eToro if: copy trading is your primary interest, you want to automatically mirror an experienced investor&#x27;s portfolio, you&#x27;re interested in Smart Portfolios, or you want a social investing community around your investments.</p>
        <p>Choose Trading 212 if: you want a Stocks &amp; Shares ISA, you&#x27;re a self-directed investor who picks their own stocks and ETFs, you value lower spreads on frequent trades, or you want interest on your uninvested cash.</p>
        <p>I use eToro as my primary platform because copy trading is central to my strategy. For a pure stock and ETF ISA, Trading 212 would be my recommendation. For many UK investors, having both accounts makes sense — eToro for copy trading, Trading 212 for long-term ISA investing.</p>
