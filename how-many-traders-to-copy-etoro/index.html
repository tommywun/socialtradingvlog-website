Too few and a single bad trader tanks your portfolio. Too many and you&#x27;re diluting any edge your research gives you. Here&#x27;s how I think about it.</p>

          <strong>Risk Warning</strong>
          eToro is a multi-asset investment platform. The value of your investments may go up or down. 51% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with eToro. You should consider whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money. This content is for educational and informational purposes only — it is not investment advice.

        <h2 id="why-diversification-matters">Why Diversification Matters in Copy Trading</h2>
        <p>When you copy a trader on eToro, you&#x27;re placing a significant bet on one person&#x27;s skill and decision-making. Even excellent traders have bad years. Markets change, strategies that worked in bull markets fail in bear markets, and personal circumstances can affect performance.</p>
        <p>If you copy only one trader and they underperform badly — say, down 40% in a year — your entire investment takes that hit. If you copy ten traders and one underperforms badly, the other nine can cushion the impact.</p>
        <p>Diversification in copy trading doesn&#x27;t mean copying anyone and everyone. It means deliberately choosing traders with different styles, different asset classes, and different risk profiles so that not all of them will fail in the same market conditions.</p>
        <h2 id="minimum-trade-size-problem">The Minimum Trade Size Problem</h2>
        <p>There&#x27;s a practical constraint that many beginners overlook: eToro requires a minimum copy amount of $200 per trader, and each individual trade within a copy must be above a minimum value (typically around $1).</p>
        <p>If you copy a trader with $200 and they put 0.5% of their portfolio into a small position, your equivalent is $1 — right at the threshold. If your copy amount is too small relative to the trader&#x27;s position sizes, some trades won&#x27;t execute at all, meaning your copy is incomplete and your performance will diverge from theirs.</p>
        <p>This means there&#x27;s a practical lower limit to how many traders you can copy without diluting each allocation too thin. If you have $2,000 to invest and copy 10 traders, each gets $200 — the minimum. Some smaller positions may not replicate correctly.</p>
        <p>My recommendation: only divide your total investment by the number of traders you intend to copy, and ensure each allocation is meaningfully above the $200 minimum. For a $5,000 total investment, copying 5 traders at $1,000 each is more effective than copying 20 at $250.</p>
        <p class="toms-note">Quick reminder — this is just what I&#x27;ve found works for me personally. I&#x27;m not a professional and this isn&#x27;t financial advice. I&#x27;ve made plenty of allocation mistakes over the years too. Use this as a starting point, not gospel.</p>
        <h2 id="too-few-vs-too-many">Too Few vs Too Many — The Trade-offs</h2>
        <p>Copying too few traders (1–2): Your whole portfolio&#x27;s performance is driven by individual skill and luck. One bad trader destroys your year. The upside is simplicity — you can deeply research one or two people and really understand their style. But the risk concentration is high.</p>
        <p>Copying too many traders (15–20+): At this scale, your portfolio effectively becomes an average of all the traders you follow. If you&#x27;ve done your research, they should all be decent — but the portfolio stops having any real edge over a diversified index fund. And managing 20 different trading profiles quarterly is a significant time commitment.</p>
        <p>The middle ground — 5–10 traders — gives you enough diversification to survive one or two failures without the portfolio becoming unwieldy.</p>
        <h2 id="toms-sweet-spot">Tom&#x27;s Sweet Spot: 5–10 Traders</h2>
        <p>I currently copy between 7 and 10 traders at any given time. This is my personal sweet spot after years of experimentation.</p>
        <p>Each trader in my portfolio serves a distinct purpose: some focus on tech stocks, some on dividend stocks, one or two on lower-risk index-tracking approaches. When tech underperforms, the dividend traders tend to hold steadier. When markets are volatile, my lower-risk traders act as ballast.</p>
        <p>I review the lineup every three to six months. This isn&#x27;t daily monitoring — just a quarterly check-in to see if any trader&#x27;s risk score has changed significantly, whether returns are in line with expectations, and whether there&#x27;s anyone on my watchlist who looks better than someone I&#x27;m currently copying.</p>
        <p>The most important rule: each position in my portfolio is large enough to actually replicate the trader&#x27;s strategy correctly. I don&#x27;t copy anyone with less than $500, even if the eToro minimum is $200.</p>
