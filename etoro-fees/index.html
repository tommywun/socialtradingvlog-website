        <p class="article-intro">eToro&#x27;s fee structure has changed over the years. When I started using the platform in 2017 it was genuinely zero-commission on stocks — that was a real selling point at the time. In early 2025 they introduced per-trade stock commissions. This page is my honest breakdown of what you&#x27;ll actually pay in 2026, based on eToro&#x27;s official fees page. For most copy traders and long-term investors the overall cost is still reasonable — but it&#x27;s worth understanding the full picture before you deposit.</p>

          <strong>Risk Warning</strong>
          eToro is a multi-asset investment platform. The value of your investments may go up or down. 51% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with eToro. You should consider whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money. This content is for educational and informational purposes only — it is not investment advice.

        </div>

        <h2 id="account-fees">Account Fees</h2>
        <p class="toms-note">The fee information on this page is taken directly from eToro&#x27;s official fees page (etoro.com/trading/fees) and is accurate as of 17 February 2026. Fees change — sometimes without much notice — so always check eToro&#x27;s live fees page for the most current information before making any decisions. This is not financial advice — I&#x27;m a regular eToro user, not a financial adviser.</p>
        <p>Opening and managing an eToro account is free. No account opening fee, no monthly management fee.</p>
        <p>Withdrawals cost a flat $5 if you&#x27;re on a USD account. If you have a local currency account — GBP, EUR, AUD or DKK — withdrawals to external accounts are free. The minimum withdrawal from a USD account is $30; there&#x27;s no minimum from a local currency account.</p>
        <p>There&#x27;s a $10/month inactivity fee after 12 consecutive months with no logins. Easy enough to avoid — just log in occasionally, even if you&#x27;re not actively trading.</p>
        <h2 id="stock-fees">Stock Trading Fees — The New Commission</h2>
        <p>eToro brought stock trading commissions back in early 2025. They had previously scrapped them altogether — a zero-commission model used to onboard a massive wave of new users — but in 2025 they reintroduced them, in a fairly limited form. For most exchanges it&#x27;s $1 per trade, charged on both opening and closing a position. For Australian, Hong Kong, Dubai and Abu Dhabi exchanges the commission is $2 per trade.</p>
        <p>Commissions are calculated in USD regardless of the base currency of the stock. There&#x27;s no additional spread markup from eToro on real stock trades — you pay the natural market spread.</p>
        <p>Important carve-outs: the commission does not apply to ETFs, CFD positions on stocks, copy trading, Smart Portfolios, or the opening leg of recurring investment plans.</p>
        <p>You can see the estimated commission cost by tapping &#x27;Estimated Cost&#x27; on the trade execution screen before you confirm.</p>
        <p class="toms-note">For the record — when I first wrote about eToro, stocks were genuinely commission-free. This is no longer true for manually traded stocks. It&#x27;s still fairly cheap per trade, but it&#x27;s worth factoring in if you&#x27;re making lots of small trades.</p>
        <h2 id="etf-fees">ETF Fees — Still Free</h2>
        <p>ETFs remain commission-free, regardless of trade size or how the order was placed — manually, via CopyTrader, or Smart Portfolios.</p>
        <p>There&#x27;s no additional spread markup from eToro on ETF trades either. The cost is the natural market spread.</p>
        <p>Short-selling and leveraged ETF positions are executed as CFDs, so those do carry CFD spreads and overnight fees. Any CFD position will be clearly labelled in the trade window.</p>
        <h2 id="crypto-fees">Crypto Fees</h2>
        <p>Crypto trading carries a 1% fee both on opening and closing a position. On top of that there&#x27;s the natural market spread, though eToro markets this as a transparent P&amp;L that reflects only market movements.</p>
        <p>Transferring crypto from the eToro platform to the eToro Money crypto wallet costs 2%. Transfers from external sources to the wallet don&#x27;t incur an eToro fee — you&#x27;ll just pay the standard blockchain network fee.</p>
        <p>If you&#x27;re selling crypto for GBP or EUR from the wallet, the fee ranges from 0.6% to 1% depending on your eToro Club tier: 1% for Silver members, 0.8% for Gold and Platinum, and 0.6% for Platinum+ and Diamond.</p>
        <p>Short-selling and leveraged crypto positions are executed as CFDs and incur overnight fees. eToro marks these clearly in the trade window.</p>
        <h2 id="cfd-fees">CFD Fees — Spreads and Overnight Charges</h2>
        <p>CFDs — used for leveraged positions, short selling, and forex — don&#x27;t carry a fixed commission. Instead you pay a spread (the difference between the buy and sell price, which varies by asset) plus an overnight fee for every night you hold the position open.</p>
        <p>Overnight fees are charged daily at 21:00 GMT. Weekend fees are triple the standard overnight rate, charged either on Wednesday (for most commodities and currencies) or Friday (for most stocks, ETFs and indices).</p>
        <p>These fees compound over time. A leveraged position held open for weeks or months can accumulate significant overnight charges — this is one of the most common surprises for people who are new to CFD trading. If you&#x27;re a buy-and-hold investor with no leverage, this simply doesn&#x27;t apply to you.</p>
        <p>The full list of CFD spreads and overnight fees is published on eToro&#x27;s website and can be previewed in the trade execution screen before you open a position.</p>
        <h2 id="copy-trading-fees">Copy Trading and Smart Portfolio Fees</h2>
        <p>Copy trading and Smart Portfolios don&#x27;t carry any additional management fees or commissions beyond those that apply to the underlying assets. You pay the same spreads and commissions as if you&#x27;d placed the trades manually.</p>
        <p>For stock copy trading that means the $1/$2 per-trade commission now applies. ETF copy trading remains commission-free. Smart Portfolio stock portfolios are specifically listed by eToro as commission-free.</p>
        <p>There are no performance fees on copy trading — eToro doesn&#x27;t take a cut of your profits. The Popular Investors you copy are paid by eToro separately, funded by a share of the spreads generated by their copiers.</p>
        <h2 id="conversion-fees">Currency Conversion Fees</h2>
        <p>If you deposit in GBP or EUR and trade USD-denominated assets, a currency conversion fee applies. The exact rate varies by location, payment method, and your eToro Club tier.</p>
        <p>eToro offers local currency accounts in GBP, EUR, AUD and DKK, which can reduce conversion fees when trading assets denominated in your local currency. The account is provided by eToro Money UK Ltd (GBP) or eToro Money Malta Ltd (EUR and DKK).</p>
        <p>eToro Club members get discounts on conversion fees. Diamond members are fully exempt from FX conversion fees. Platinum and Platinum+ members receive a 50% discount. For UK investors who regularly deposit in GBP, this is one of the more tangible benefits of building up a larger balance.</p>
        <h2 id="etoro-club">eToro Club — Tiered Perks as Your Balance Grows</h2>
        <p>eToro Club is a tiered membership programme you qualify for automatically based on your account balance. The tiers are Silver ($5,000), Gold ($10,000), Platinum ($25,000), Platinum+ ($50,000) and Diamond ($250,000). Platinum is also available as a subscription for £4.99/month if you haven&#x27;t yet reached the balance threshold.</p>
        <p>The fee-related perks include: conversion fee discounts (up to full exemption at Diamond), a revenue share on crypto staking (55% at Silver, rising to 90% at Diamond), and cashback on crypto trading fees.</p>
        <p>Higher tiers also unlock interest on USD cash balances. For Diamond members in select regions this is 3.55%. Platinum+ and Diamond members also get free insurance coverage through Lloyd&#x27;s of London for up to $1 million.</p>
        <p>For practical day-to-day fee differences, Silver and Gold members save modestly on conversion fees. The bigger cost advantages — full FX fee exemption, higher interest rates, no withdrawal fees — only kick in at Platinum+ and Diamond.</p>
        <p class="toms-note">I&#x27;m not at Diamond tier myself. But if you&#x27;re depositing regularly in GBP, even the Silver-tier conversion fee discount starts to add up over time.</p>
