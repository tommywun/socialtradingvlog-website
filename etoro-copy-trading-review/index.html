You need patience, diversification (copy at least 5 traders), and the ability to leave your portfolio alone for months at a time. If you treat it as a long-term, mostly passive investment strategy, it can absolutely be worth it. If you're expecting guaranteed profits every month, you'll be disappointed."

        <h2 id="what-is-copy-trading">What Is eToro Copy Trading? (Quick Overview)</h2>

        <p>If you&#x27;re brand new to this, here&#x27;s the short version. eToro&#x27;s CopyTrader feature lets you automatically replicate another trader&#x27;s portfolio and trades in real time. You pick a trader, allocate a minimum of $200, and from that point on, everything they do &mdash; you do proportionally.</p>

        <p>If the trader you&#x27;re copying buys Tesla, you buy Tesla. If they sell it, you sell it. If they open a Bitcoin position at 5% of their portfolio, you open the same position at 5% of whatever amount you&#x27;ve allocated to copy them. It&#x27;s completely automatic once set up.</p>

        <p>The traders you can copy are real eToro users &mdash; not algorithms or bots. Many of them are part of eToro&#x27;s <strong>Popular Investor programme</strong>, which means eToro pays them based on how many people copy them and how much money is allocated. This creates an incentive for them to trade well and communicate openly with their copiers.</p>

        <p>I&#x27;ve written a much more detailed explanation in my <a href="../copy-trading.html">What is Copy Trading?</a> guide if you want the full background. But for this review, I&#x27;m going to assume you have a basic understanding and focus on whether it actually works &mdash; based on nearly 10 years of doing it.</p>

        <!-- ============================================ -->
        <!-- SECTION: How Copy Trading Works              -->
        <!-- ============================================ -->

        <h2 id="how-it-works">How Copy Trading Works on eToro (Step by Step)</h2>

        <p>The process is genuinely simple. Here&#x27;s exactly what happens when you copy someone on eToro:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Search for traders.</strong> Use eToro&#x27;s Discover page or the CopyTrader section to browse traders. You can filter by return, risk score, number of copiers, asset classes, country, and more.</li>
          <li><strong>Review their profile.</strong> Before you copy anyone, you can see their full trading history, portfolio composition, <a href="../etoro-risk-score-explained/">risk score</a>, monthly returns, and how they&#x27;ve performed over 1, 2, or more years. This transparency is one of eToro&#x27;s best features.</li>
          <li><strong>Click &#x27;Copy&#x27;.</strong> Once you&#x27;ve found someone you like, hit the Copy button on their profile.</li>
          <li><strong>Choose your amount.</strong> The minimum is $200 per trader. You decide how much of your funds to allocate to copying this person.</li>
          <li><strong>Choose whether to copy open trades.</strong> You can either copy all of their currently open positions (proportionally), or start fresh and only copy new trades they make going forward. I generally copy open trades so I get their full current portfolio, but it depends on the situation.</li>
          <li><strong>Set a Copy Stop Loss (CSL).</strong> This is a safety net. If the value of your copy relationship drops by a certain percentage, it automatically stops copying and closes all positions from that trader. I&#x27;ll talk more about my recommended CSL settings <a href="#tips">later in this article</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>That&#x27;s it &mdash; it&#x27;s automatic from here.</strong> Every trade they make is replicated in your account in real time. You don&#x27;t have to do anything.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The whole setup takes about 5 minutes per trader. And once it&#x27;s running, it&#x27;s genuinely hands-off. I check my portfolio maybe once a week now &mdash; sometimes less. That&#x27;s the appeal.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">One thing to understand: when you copy someone, the allocated amount is ring-fenced. If you allocate $500 to copy Trader A, that $500 (plus or minus gains and losses) is tied to that copy relationship. You can stop copying at any time, which closes all the copied positions and returns the funds to your available balance.</p>

        <!-- SECTION: My Results After Nearly 10 Years    -->
        <!-- ============================================ -->

        <h2 id="my-results">My Copy Trading Results After Nearly 10 Years</h2>

        <p>This is the section everyone wants to read, so I&#x27;ll be straight with you.</p>

        <p>Over nearly 10 years of copy trading on eToro, my results have been &mdash; mixed. And I mean that honestly. Some years were genuinely great. I had stretches where my portfolio was growing steadily, the traders I was copying were making smart moves, and everything felt like it was working exactly as advertised. Other years were tough. I&#x27;ve had copied traders go through brutal drawdowns. I&#x27;ve had traders I trusted change their strategy mid-copy. I&#x27;ve made the classic mistake of panic-stopping a copy after one bad month, only to watch them recover beautifully the next quarter &mdash; without me.</p>

        <p>I&#x27;m not going to share specific dollar amounts here, because my account size has changed significantly over the years and the numbers without context would be misleading. What I will say is this: <strong>copy trading is not a get-rich-quick scheme</strong>. Anyone who tells you otherwise is selling something.</p>

        <p>If you want detailed performance data and a more granular breakdown of how my copy trading has performed year by year, I&#x27;ve documented that on my <a href="../copy-trading-returns.html">copy trading returns</a> page. I&#x27;ve also been sharing monthly updates on my <a href="../videos.html">YouTube channel</a> since the beginning, so the entire journey is publicly documented.</p>

        <p>Here&#x27;s what nearly 10 years has actually taught me:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Patience is everything.</strong> The best returns came from traders I stuck with through rough patches. The worst outcomes came from switching traders constantly.</li>
          <li><strong>Diversification isn&#x27;t optional.</strong> The years I had all my funds in 1-2 traders were the most stressful and the most volatile. When I started copying 5+ traders with different strategies, things smoothed out considerably.</li>
          <li><strong>Risk management matters more than returns.</strong> A trader who makes 15% a year consistently with a low risk score is far better than someone who makes 80% one year and loses 40% the next. I wrote more about this in my <a href="../etoro-risk-score-explained/">risk score explained</a> guide.</li>
          <li><strong>The market humbles everyone eventually.</strong> Every trader &mdash; no matter how talented &mdash; will have losing periods. COVID in 2020, the crypto crash, the 2022 bear market &mdash; these events hit everyone. The question isn&#x27;t whether they&#x27;ll lose money, but how they manage the downturn.</li>
          <li><strong>I learned more doing this than any course could teach.</strong> By watching what real traders do &mdash; the assets they pick, how they size positions, when they take profits, how they handle losses &mdash; I&#x27;ve built up a genuine understanding of <a href="../social-trading.html">social trading</a> and market mechanics that I never would have got from textbooks.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So was it worth it? For me, yes &mdash; but not purely because of returns. It was worth it because it gave me a way into investing that felt accessible, educational, and genuinely passive once set up. I don&#x27;t regret a single year of it.</p>

        <div class="risk-warning">
          <strong>Important</strong>
          Past performance is not an indication of future results. My experience over nearly 10 years is personal and may not reflect yours. All trading involves risk. 51% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with eToro. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.

        <!-- ============================================ -->
        <!-- SECTION: Best Things                        -->
        <!-- ============================================ -->

        <h2 id="best-things">The Best Things About eToro Copy Trading</h2>

        <p>After nearly a decade, here&#x27;s what I genuinely think eToro gets right with copy trading.</p>

        <h3>1. Genuinely passive once set up</h3>

        <p>This isn&#x27;t a buzzword. Once you&#x27;ve chosen your traders and hit Copy, there is literally nothing you need to do. The trades happen automatically. I&#x27;ve had weeks where I didn&#x27;t even open the app, and my portfolio was being managed the whole time. For someone who doesn&#x27;t want to sit in front of charts all day, this is the main selling point &mdash; and it delivers. I explored this topic in detail in my <a href="../is-copy-trading-passive-income/">is copy trading passive income?</a> article.</p>

        <h3>2. Learn by watching what real traders do</h3>

        <p>This one is underrated. When you copy someone, you can see every trade they make, when they make it, and how they size their positions. Over time, you start to recognise patterns. You learn why someone might buy the dip on a stock, or why they take profit at a certain level. It&#x27;s like an investing apprenticeship &mdash; you&#x27;re learning by watching professionals operate with real money. This is what <a href="../social-trading.html">social trading</a> is really about.</p>

        <h3>3. Diversification is easy</h3>

        <p>On your own, building a diversified portfolio takes research, time, and a decent amount of capital. With copy trading, you can copy 5 different traders who each focus on different asset classes or strategies, and instantly you have a diversified portfolio. One might focus on tech stocks, another on forex, another on a balanced long-term approach. I wrote about the ideal number of traders to copy in my <a href="../how-many-traders-to-copy-etoro/">how many traders to copy</a> guide.</p>

        <h3>4. Transparent &mdash; you can see full trading history before copying</h3>

        <p>This is something eToro does better than most competitors. Before you copy anyone, you can see their full trading history going back years. Monthly returns, risk scores, portfolio breakdown, how long they typically hold positions, what assets they trade &mdash; it&#x27;s all there. No black box. You&#x27;re making an informed decision based on real data.</p>

        <h3>5. Copy trading is exempt from eToro&#x27;s stock commissions</h3>

        <p>Since eToro reintroduced stock commissions in 2025, this matters more than it used to. If you buy stocks manually on eToro, you now pay $1-$2 per trade. But trades executed through copy trading are exempt from that commission. If you&#x27;re copying a trader who buys and sells stocks frequently, that fee exemption adds up. I break down all the costs in my <a href="../etoro-fees/">eToro fees explained</a> guide.</p>

        <h3>6. Good for beginners who don&#x27;t know how to trade yet</h3>

        <p>Let&#x27;s be honest &mdash; most people who open a trading account don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing. Copy trading gives beginners a way to participate in the markets without needing to understand technical analysis, fundamental analysis, or any of the jargon. You&#x27;re essentially outsourcing the decision-making to someone with more experience. It&#x27;s not a replacement for learning, but it&#x27;s a far better starting point than blindly buying meme stocks.</p>

        <!-- ============================================ -->
        <!-- SECTION: Worst Things                       -->
        <!-- ============================================ -->

        <h2 id="worst-things">The Worst Things About eToro Copy Trading (Honest Negatives)</h2>

        <p>No review is worth reading if it only covers the positives. Here are the genuine downsides &mdash; some of which I&#x27;ve learned the hard way.</p>

        <h3>1. You&#x27;re trusting someone else with your money</h3>

        <p>This is the fundamental trade-off. When you copy someone, you&#x27;re handing over decision-making to a stranger on the internet. Yes, you can see their history. Yes, eToro has systems in place. But ultimately, you&#x27;re trusting that this person will continue to trade responsibly with your capital on the line. That requires a certain comfort level that not everyone has &mdash; and honestly, not everyone should have.</p>

        <h3>2. Copied traders can and do lose money &mdash; sometimes a lot</h3>

        <p>This needs to be said clearly. I&#x27;ve had copied traders who looked fantastic on paper &mdash; great two-year track record, low risk score, thousands of copiers &mdash; and then went through a terrible stretch. Markets turn, strategies stop working, traders make mistakes. If someone tells you copy trading is low risk, they haven&#x27;t done it long enough. It is real investing with real risk.</p>

        <h3>3. The $200 minimum per trader limits small accounts</h3>

        <p>If you want to properly diversify by copying 5 traders, you need at least $1,000. For someone just starting out, that&#x27;s a meaningful amount. And $200 per trader is the minimum &mdash; for the copy to be properly proportional and have room to breathe, you often want more. I talk about minimum deposits in more detail in my <a href="../etoro-minimum-deposit/">eToro minimum deposit</a> guide. This minimum can be a barrier for people who want to start really small.</p>

        <h3>4. You can&#x27;t customise individual trades (it&#x27;s all or nothing)</h3>

        <p>When you copy someone, you copy everything they do. You can&#x27;t say &#x27;I like their stock picks but not their crypto trades.&#x27; It&#x27;s all or nothing. If a trader you&#x27;re copying makes a trade you disagree with, your only option is to manually close that individual position (which breaks the copy proportionality) or stop copying them entirely. There&#x27;s no filter for specific asset classes or trade types.</p>

        <h3>5. Currency conversion fees eat into returns for non-USD accounts</h3>

        <p>eToro&#x27;s platform operates in USD. If you&#x27;re depositing in GBP, EUR, or any other currency, you&#x27;ll pay a conversion fee on deposits and withdrawals. These fees compound over time and eat into your overall returns in a way that&#x27;s easy to overlook. I&#x27;ve written about this in detail in my <a href="../etoro-fees/">fees guide</a> and the <a href="../etoro-copy-trading-fees/">copy trading fees</a> breakdown.

        <h3>6. &#x27;Popular&#x27; doesn&#x27;t always mean &#x27;good&#x27;</h3>

        <p>One of the traps new users fall into is sorting traders by number of copiers and assuming the most-copied traders must be the best. That&#x27;s not always true. Some traders accumulate copiers during a hot streak and then underperform. Some are better at self-promotion than actual trading. Copier count can be a useful signal, but it shouldn&#x27;t be your primary filter. I go deep into what actually matters in my <a href="../how-to-choose-copy-traders-etoro/">how to choose copy traders</a> guide.</p>

        <h3>7. The temptation to keep swapping traders after one bad month</h3>

        <p>This is, hands down, the single worst mistake I&#x27;ve made in nearly 10 years of copy trading. A trader has a bad month. You panic. You stop copying them and switch to someone who had a great month. Then the trader you left recovers, and the &#x27;hot&#x27; trader you switched to has a bad month next. You&#x27;ve locked in losses and missed the recovery. I call this the &#x27;copy trading carousel&#x27; and it destroys returns more than anything else. Patience is not optional &mdash; it&#x27;s the whole game.</p>

        <h2 id="who-is-it-for">Who Is Copy Trading Good For? (And Who Should Avoid It)</h2>

        <p>After nearly 10 years, I have a pretty clear picture of who copy trading works well for and who should probably steer clear.</p>

        <h3>Copy trading is good for:</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Complete beginners</strong> who want exposure to the markets but don&#x27;t have the knowledge or confidence to pick individual stocks, forex pairs, or crypto positions on their own.</li>
          <li><strong>People who want passive investing.</strong> If you don&#x27;t want to watch charts, read earnings reports, or stress about market timing &mdash; copy trading lets you participate without the daily effort.</li>
          <li><strong>People who want to learn trading by watching others.</strong> If you&#x27;re curious about how professional traders think and operate, copy trading is one of the best ways to learn by observation.</li>
          <li><strong>Long-term thinkers.</strong> If you can commit to leaving your copy running for 6-12+ months without panicking at every red day, you&#x27;re the ideal copy trading user.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Copy trading is probably not for you if:</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>You want full control over every trade.</strong> If you want to decide exactly what to buy, when to buy it, and at what price &mdash; copy trading will frustrate you. You&#x27;re deliberately giving up control.</li>
          <li><strong>You&#x27;re looking for guaranteed returns.</strong> There are no guarantees. Some months will be red. Some quarters will be painful. If you can&#x27;t accept that, this isn&#x27;t the right approach for you.</li>
          <li><strong>You can&#x27;t handle seeing your money go down temporarily.</strong> Markets go down. Sometimes for weeks or months. If seeing a negative number on your screen makes you immediately want to sell everything, copy trading will be a stressful experience.</li>
          <li><strong>You&#x27;re investing money you need in the short term.</strong> Never copy trade with money you might need within the next year. This is a long-term strategy. If you&#x27;re going to need the money in 3 months, put it in a savings account, not a copy trading portfolio.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you&#x27;re not sure whether you&#x27;re in the right camp, my advice is simple: start with the minimum $200, copy one trader, and see how you feel after a month. That&#x27;s a low enough cost of entry to figure out if this suits your temperament. Check out my <a href="../about.html">about page</a> to learn more about my own journey and how I got started.</p>

        <div class="risk-warning">
          <strong>Reminder</strong>
          Copy Trading does not amount to investment advice. The value of your investments may go up or down. Your capital is at risk. 51% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with eToro.

        <!-- ============================================ -->

        <h2 id="fees">Copy Trading Fees Breakdown</h2>

        <p>One of the things I appreciate about eToro&#x27;s copy trading is that there&#x27;s <strong>no management fee</strong>. You don&#x27;t pay a percentage of assets under management. You don&#x27;t pay a performance fee. eToro pays their Popular Investors separately &mdash; it doesn&#x27;t come out of your returns.</p>

        <p>That said, copy trading is not free. The underlying trades still carry costs:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Spreads</strong> &mdash; the difference between buy and sell prices, especially on CFDs and crypto positions.</li>
          <li><strong>Overnight fees</strong> &mdash; if the copied trader holds leveraged or short CFD positions, you&#x27;ll be charged overnight financing fees daily.</li>
          <li><strong>Currency conversion fees</strong> &mdash; if you deposit in GBP, EUR, or another non-USD currency, conversion fees apply on deposits and can chip away at returns over time.</li>
          <li><strong>No stock commission on copy trades</strong> &mdash; this is a genuine advantage. Since eToro reintroduced stock commissions in 2025, copy trading positions are exempt. That saves you $1-$2 per trade compared to buying the same stocks manually.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I&#x27;ve written a complete, detailed breakdown of every fee that applies to copy trading in my dedicated <a href="../etoro-copy-trading-fees/">eToro copy trading fees</a> article. If costs are a concern for you &mdash; and they should be, because fees compound over years &mdash; I&#x27;d recommend reading that before you start. You can also check my broader <a href="../etoro-fees/">eToro fees guide</a> for the full platform fee structure, and my <a href="../etoro-spread-fees/">spread fees breakdown</a> for specifics on CFD costs.</p>

        <h2 id="choosing-traders">How to Choose Traders to Copy (My Criteria)</h2>

        <p>This is arguably the most important decision you&#x27;ll make in copy trading, and it&#x27;s where most people get it wrong. I&#x27;ve written a full, detailed guide on this: <a href="../how-to-choose-copy-traders-etoro/">how to choose copy traders on eToro</a>. But here are the key criteria I use after nearly 10 years of doing this:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>At least 2 years of trading history on eToro.</strong> Anyone can have a lucky 6 months. Two years of data gives you enough to see how they perform in both good and bad markets.</li>
          <li><strong>Risk score under 5.</strong> eToro&#x27;s <a href="../etoro-risk-score-explained/">risk score</a> runs from 1 (low) to 10 (high). Personally, I rarely copy anyone above a 4 or 5. Higher risk means higher potential returns, but also much higher drawdowns. I&#x27;ve been burned by high-risk traders before.</li>
          <li><strong>Consistent returns over flashy ones.</strong> I&#x27;d rather copy someone who makes 10-20% per year consistently than someone who made 100% once and is now sitting at -30%. Consistency is the signal. Spikes are noise.</li>
          <li><strong>Good communication.</strong> The best Popular Investors post regular updates explaining their strategy, what they&#x27;re thinking, and what&#x27;s happening in the markets. If a trader doesn&#x27;t communicate at all, I&#x27;m less confident they take their copiers seriously.</li>
          <li><strong>Reasonable number of assets.</strong> A trader with 200 open positions is basically an index fund with higher fees. I prefer traders who run concentrated, intentional portfolios &mdash; usually 10-40 positions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For the complete walkthrough with more criteria and examples, read the <a href="../best-traders-to-copy-etoro/">best traders to copy on eToro</a> guide.</p>

        <!-- ============================================ -->

        <h2 id="vs-alternatives">eToro Copy Trading vs. Alternatives</h2>

        <p>eToro isn&#x27;t the only platform offering copy trading or social trading features. But after trying and researching the alternatives, I keep coming back to eToro. Here&#x27;s why, and where the competitors stand:</p>

        <h3>ZuluTrade</h3>
        <p>ZuluTrade is the most direct competitor. It connects to multiple brokers, which gives you more flexibility in terms of where your funds are held. The signal provider network is decent, and they have some good risk management tools. But the user experience is less polished than eToro, the community is smaller, and the broker integration adds a layer of complexity that eToro doesn&#x27;t have. If you want broker choice, ZuluTrade is worth a look. If you want simplicity and a large community, eToro wins.</p>

        <h3>NAGA</h3>
        <p>NAGA offers a similar social trading concept with a feed, copy trading, and a range of assets. The platform looks slick. But the community is significantly smaller than eToro&#x27;s, which means fewer traders to copy and less data to evaluate them with. For copy trading specifically, community size matters &mdash; more traders means more options, more competition, and better data. NAGA just can&#x27;t match eToro&#x27;s network effects yet.</p>

        <h3>Trading 212 &#x27;Pies&#x27;</h3>
        <p>Trading 212&#x27;s Pies feature lets you share and copy portfolio allocations &mdash; but it&#x27;s not real-time copy trading in the way eToro does it. You&#x27;re copying a portfolio structure, not live trades. There&#x27;s no automatic replication of buy and sell decisions. It&#x27;s more like portfolio sharing than true copy trading. I compared the two platforms in detail in my <a href="../etoro-vs-trading-212/">eToro vs. Trading 212</a> article.</p>

        <h3>The bottom line on alternatives</h3>
        <p>None of these platforms match eToro&#x27;s combination of community size, transparency, ease of use, and track record. eToro has been doing copy trading since 2010 and has millions of users worldwide. That ecosystem &mdash; the sheer number of traders to choose from, the depth of performance data, the Popular Investor programme incentivising quality &mdash; is something no competitor has replicated. That&#x27;s not to say eToro is perfect. It&#x27;s not. But for copy trading specifically, it&#x27;s still the best platform I&#x27;ve used.</p>

        <!-- ============================================ -->

        <h2 id="tips">Tips From Nearly 10 Years of Copy Trading</h2>

        <p>If I could go back to 2016 and give myself advice before I started, this is exactly what I&#x27;d say. These lessons cost me time and money to learn &mdash; hopefully they save you some of both.</p>

        <h3>1. Don&#x27;t invest money you can&#x27;t afford to lose</h3>
        <p>I know this sounds like a clich&eacute; disclaimer, but I mean it as practical advice. Copy trading is investing in the financial markets. Markets go down. Sometimes they go down a lot. If losing 30% of your copy trading balance would cause you genuine financial hardship, you&#x27;ve invested too much. Only use money that you won&#x27;t need for at least 1-2 years &mdash; ideally longer.</p>

        <h3>2. Start with the minimum and increase once you&#x27;re comfortable</h3>
        <p>There&#x27;s no prize for going all-in on day one. Start with $200 per trader, copy a couple of people, and just watch. Get a feel for how it works, how your emotions respond to green and red days, and whether this style of investing suits your temperament. You can always add more later. I talk about getting started with minimal capital in my <a href="../etoro-minimum-deposit/">minimum deposit guide</a>.</p>

        <h3>3. Copy at least 5 traders to diversify</h3>
        <p>This is one of the most important lessons I&#x27;ve learned. If you only copy one or two traders, your returns are entirely dependent on those individuals. If one has a bad quarter, your whole portfolio suffers. Copying 5+ traders with different strategies and asset focuses smooths out the volatility significantly. I wrote a whole article on this: <a href="../how-many-traders-to-copy-etoro/">how many traders to copy on eToro</a>.</p>

        <h3>4. Don&#x27;t check your portfolio every day</h3>
        <p>Copy trading is supposed to be passive. The whole point is that someone else is managing the trades. If you&#x27;re checking the app every hour, you&#x27;re adding stress without adding value. Set it up, check in once a week or once a month, and let it do its thing. The daily fluctuations are noise &mdash; what matters is the long-term trend.</p>

        <h3>5. Give copied traders at least 6-12 months before judging results</h3>
        <p>I cannot stress this enough. One month is not enough data. Even three months can be misleading. Markets have cycles. A trader who loses 5% in January might gain 20% over the full year. If you stop copying after one bad month, you lock in the loss and miss the recovery. I&#x27;ve done this. It&#x27;s the most expensive mistake in copy trading. Give it time.</p>

        <h3>6. The best traders to copy are boring</h3>
        <p>Seriously. The traders who deliver the best long-term results on eToro are not the ones making flashy, aggressive trades. They&#x27;re the ones who make steady, consistent returns with low risk scores. They&#x27;re patient. They&#x27;re diversified. They&#x27;re boring. And that&#x27;s exactly what you want in someone managing your money. Boring is beautiful in copy trading. Read more in my <a href="../best-traders-to-copy-etoro/">best traders to copy</a> guide.</p>

        <h3>7. Set a Copy Stop Loss &mdash; but not too tight</h3>
        <p>eToro lets you set a Copy Stop Loss (CSL) for each trader you copy. If the copy relationship drops below a certain value, it automatically stops and all positions are closed. This is a useful safety net. But if you set it too tight &mdash; like 10% or 15% &mdash; it&#x27;ll get triggered during normal market volatility, which defeats the purpose. I personally set mine at around 40-50%, which is wide enough to ride out bad stretches but tight enough to protect against a complete meltdown.</p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Is eToro copy trading worth it?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">After nearly 10 years of using it, I&#x27;d say yes &mdash; but with realistic expectations. It&#x27;s not a get-rich-quick scheme. You need patience, diversification (copy at least 5 traders), and the ability to leave your portfolio alone for months at a time. If you treat it as a long-term, mostly passive investment strategy, it can absolutely be worth it. If you&#x27;re expecting guaranteed profits every month, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">What is the minimum to start copy trading on eToro?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">The minimum amount to copy a single trader on eToro is $200. There&#x27;s no separate fee to use the copy trading feature itself. If you want to copy 5 traders for proper diversification, you&#x27;d need at least $1,000. I&#x27;d recommend starting with the minimum per trader and increasing once you&#x27;re comfortable with how it works.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Can you lose money copy trading on eToro?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">Yes, absolutely. Copy trading carries real risk. The traders you copy can and do lose money &mdash; sometimes significantly. 51% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with eToro. Never invest money you can&#x27;t afford to lose, and always diversify across multiple traders rather than putting everything into one person.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Does eToro charge fees for copy trading?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">There&#x27;s no management fee or performance fee for using eToro&#x27;s copy trading feature. However, the underlying trades still incur costs: spreads on CFDs, overnight fees on leveraged positions, and currency conversion fees for non-USD accounts. Copy trading is exempt from eToro&#x27;s per-trade stock commission, which is a genuine cost advantage over manual trading.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">How many traders should I copy on eToro?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">I recommend copying at least 5 traders to properly diversify your risk. Ideally, choose traders with different strategies, asset focuses, and risk profiles. Don&#x27;t put all your copy trading funds into one person, no matter how good their track record looks. Spreading across 5-10 traders helps smooth out the inevitable rough patches.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">How long should I copy a trader before judging their results?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">I recommend giving a copied trader at least 6 to 12 months before making a judgment. One bad week or even one bad month doesn&#x27;t mean the trader is bad &mdash; markets go through cycles. The biggest mistake I see (and one I&#x27;ve made myself) is swapping traders after a single bad month. That&#x27;s a recipe for locking in losses and missing recoveries.</p>
