        <!-- ==================== DAVID VS GOLIATH ==================== -->

        <h2 id="david-vs-goliath">David vs Goliath</h2>

        <p>Interactive Brokers is a <strong>$15+ billion institutional-grade brokerage</strong> publicly traded on NASDAQ. It provides access to <strong>150+ exchanges in 33 countries</strong>, offers every asset class imaginable (stocks, options, futures, forex, bonds, mutual funds, metals, crypto), and has some of the lowest trading costs in the entire industry.</p>

        <p>eToro is a <strong>social trading platform</strong> with 35+ million users, known for copy trading, an approachable interface, and making investing accessible to beginners. It offers real stocks, ETFs, CFDs, and 80+ cryptocurrencies across around 17 exchanges.</p>

        <p>Comparing them directly feels almost unfair. It is like comparing a friendly neighbourhood gym to an Olympic training facility. Both serve a purpose, both have their users &mdash; but they are built for different performance levels.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">I want to be completely honest here. On almost every objective metric &mdash; cost, market access, tools, financial strength &mdash; Interactive Brokers is the superior brokerage. But eToro has something IBKR does not and probably never will: genuine copy trading and a social investing community. That is why I still use eToro.</p>

        <!-- ==================== FEES ==================== -->

        <h2 id="fees-comparison">The Fee Deep-Dive</h2>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Fee Type</th><th>Interactive Brokers</th><th>eToro</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td><strong>US Stock Commission</strong></td><td>$0 (IBKR Lite) or $0.005/share (Pro)</td><td>$0</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Forex</strong></td><td>0.08&ndash;0.2 basis points (~$2 min)</td><td>Spread-based (~1 pip EUR/USD)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Options</strong></td><td>$0.15&ndash;$0.65 per contract</td><td>Not available</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Futures</strong></td><td>$0.25&ndash;$0.85 per contract</td><td>Not available</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Withdrawal Fee</strong></td><td>1 free/month, then $10 (wire)</td><td>$5 every time</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Inactivity Fee</strong></td><td>$0</td><td>$10/month after 12 months</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Currency Conversion</strong></td><td>~0.002% ($2 min)</td><td>0.5% (50 pips)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Margin Rates</strong></td><td>Benchmark + 1.5% (&gt;$100K)</td><td>Overnight fee on CFDs (higher)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Interest on Cash</strong></td><td>Yes (competitive rates)</td><td>Limited</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>On commission-free US stocks, both platforms are equal if you use IBKR Lite. On everything else &mdash; forex, margin, currency conversion, options, futures &mdash; IBKR wins convincingly. The fee gap is not small; it is enormous on certain metrics.</p>

        <!-- ==================== CURRENCY CONVERSION ==================== -->

        <h2 id="currency-conversion">Currency Conversion: The Hidden Cost</h2>

        <p>This is the single biggest revelation when comparing these two platforms, and the reason I think every non-USD investor should know about it.</p>

        <p><strong>eToro charges 0.5% (50 pips) on currency conversion.</strong> If you deposit &pound;10,000 and it gets converted to USD, you pay approximately &pound;50 in conversion fees. When you withdraw back to GBP, you pay another &pound;50. That is &pound;100 in round-trip conversion costs alone.</p>

        <p><strong>Interactive Brokers charges approximately 0.002% with a $2 minimum.</strong> The same &pound;10,000 conversion costs roughly $2. The round trip is about $4.</p>

        <p>That is not a typo. <strong>&pound;100 vs $4 for the same operation.</strong></p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Amount Invested</th><th>eToro Conversion Cost</th><th>IBKR Conversion Cost</th><th>Difference</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>&pound;1,000</td><td>~&pound;10</td><td>~$2</td><td>&pound;8</td></tr>
            <tr><td>&pound;10,000</td><td>~&pound;100</td><td>~$2</td><td>&pound;98</td></tr>
            <tr><td>&pound;50,000</td><td>~&pound;500</td><td>~$10</td><td>&pound;490</td></tr>
            <tr><td>&pound;100,000</td><td>~&pound;1,000</td><td>~$20</td><td>&pound;980</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p class="toms-note">This was genuinely eye-opening when I first looked at the numbers. For small investments, the difference is manageable. But as your portfolio grows, eToro&#x27;s 0.5% conversion fee becomes a significant drag. If I were investing &pound;50,000+ of my own capital directly in US stocks, I would seriously consider IBKR for that portion. For copy trading, eToro remains my platform because IBKR simply does not offer it.</p>

        <!-- ==================== COPY TRADING VS TOOLS ==================== -->

        <h2 id="copy-trading-vs-tools">Copy Trading vs Professional Tools</h2>

        <p>eToro&#x27;s <a href="../copy-trading.html">CopyTrader</a> is unmatched. No other major regulated broker offers anything comparable. You allocate money to copy a trader, and their trades are automatically replicated in your account. It is the core reason millions of people use eToro.</p>

        <p>Interactive Brokers has &ldquo;Interactive Advisors&rdquo; (formerly Covestor) which offers managed portfolio strategies, and there are marketplace signal providers. But this is not copy trading in the eToro sense. You cannot browse individual traders, see their live track records, and one-click copy them.</p>

        <p>What IBKR offers instead is <strong>professional-grade trading tools</strong>: Trader Workstation (TWS) with advanced charting, algorithmic trading, API access for automated strategies, portfolio analytics, risk management tools, and market scanners. These are tools for people who make their own trading decisions at a professional level.</p>

        <p>The question is simple: do you want someone else to trade for you (eToro), or do you want the best possible tools to trade for yourself (IBKR)?</p>

        <!-- ==================== AVAILABLE MARKETS ==================== -->

        <h2 id="available-markets">Available Markets</h2>

        <p>Interactive Brokers provides access to <strong>150+ exchanges in 33 countries</strong>. Stocks, ETFs, options, futures, forex (100+ pairs at interbank rates), bonds, mutual funds, metals, and crypto in some jurisdictions. Over <strong>one million tradable instruments</strong>.</p>

        <p>eToro offers approximately <strong>5,000+ instruments across ~17 exchanges</strong>. Stocks, ETFs, CFDs (forex, commodities, indices), and 80+ cryptocurrencies.</p>

        <p>For most retail investors, eToro&#x27;s selection is sufficient. Apple, Amazon, Tesla, the S&amp;P 500, Bitcoin &mdash; it is all there. But if you want to trade Japanese futures, buy bonds, trade forex at interbank rates, or access emerging market exchanges, IBKR is the only choice.</p>

        <!-- ==================== PLATFORM EXPERIENCE ==================== -->

        <h2 id="platform-experience">Platform Experience</h2>

        <p>eToro is designed for simplicity. Clean interface, social feed, one-click copy trading, and an experience that does not assume you know what a limit order is. It is genuinely pleasant to use, especially on mobile.</p>

        <p>Interactive Brokers&#x27; Trader Workstation (TWS) is powerful but intimidating. The learning curve is steep. The interface has improved significantly with their web portal and mobile app (IBKR Mobile), but TWS still looks like a Bloomberg terminal designed by engineers. It is not pretty, but it is extremely capable.</p>

        <p>IBKR has also introduced <strong>IBKR Lite</strong> &mdash; a simplified, commission-free tier for US investors that is more approachable. But even Lite users access the same underlying platform, which can feel overwhelming compared to eToro&#x27;s streamlined experience.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">Honestly, the first time I opened TWS, I closed it within 5 minutes. It felt like opening the cockpit of a Boeing 747. eToro felt like the self-driving car that just works. Over time I learned to appreciate TWS&#x27;s power, but I completely understand why beginners run from it.</p>

        <!-- ==================== REGULATION ==================== -->

        <h2 id="regulation">Regulation &amp; Financial Strength</h2>

        <table>
          <thead>

          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Interactive Brokers is one of the most heavily regulated and financially strongest brokers in the world. Its $15+ billion in equity capital and 47-year track record are unmatched. eToro is well-regulated through the FCA and CySEC, but it is a younger, smaller company by comparison.</p>

        <!-- ==================== WHO OUTGROWS ==================== -->

        <h2 id="who-outgrows">Who Outgrows eToro for IBKR?</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Large portfolio holders</strong> &mdash; the 0.5% vs 0.002% currency conversion difference becomes thousands of pounds</li>
          <li><strong>Active forex traders</strong> &mdash; IBKR&#x27;s interbank rates are orders of magnitude cheaper</li>
          <li><strong>Options and futures traders</strong> &mdash; eToro does not offer these</li>
          <li><strong>Global stock pickers</strong> &mdash; 150+ exchanges vs ~17</li>
          <li><strong>Algorithmic traders</strong> &mdash; IBKR&#x27;s API is industry-leading</li>
          <li><strong>Margin traders</strong> &mdash; IBKR has the lowest margin rates in the industry</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- ==================== WHO STAYS ==================== -->

        <h2 id="who-stays">Who Should Stay on eToro?</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Copy traders</strong> &mdash; there is no substitute for CopyTrader</li>
          <li><strong>Beginners</strong> &mdash; eToro&#x27;s learning curve is a gentle slope, not a cliff</li>
          <li><strong>Social investors</strong> &mdash; the community, feed, and Popular Investor programme have no IBKR equivalent</li>
          <li><strong>Casual crypto investors</strong> &mdash; buying Bitcoin on eToro is simpler than on IBKR</li>
          <li><strong>Smaller portfolios</strong> &mdash; when investing under &pound;10,000, the fee differences are less impactful</li>
          <li><strong>People who want simplicity</strong> &mdash; eToro just works without requiring a finance degree</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- ==================== VERDICT ==================== -->

        <h2 id="verdict">Final Verdict</h2>

        <p>Interactive Brokers is the objectively superior brokerage on almost every measurable dimension: cost, market access, tools, financial strength, and regulatory coverage. This is not a controversial opinion &mdash; it is simply what the numbers show.</p>

        <p>But eToro offers something IBKR cannot: <strong>genuine copy trading</strong>. The ability to automatically mirror an experienced investor&#x27;s trades, learn from a community, and participate in a social investing ecosystem. That is why I still use eToro after nearly 10 years, and why millions of others do too.</p>

        <p>The smartest approach might be to use both. eToro for copy trading and social investing. IBKR for self-directed investing, especially as your portfolio grows and the currency conversion savings become significant.</p>
