## Negotiation Strategy

### Leverage Points (use across all pitches)
1. **66K subscribers + 4.5M views** — legitimate mid-tier finance creator
2. **Nearly 10 years of continuous content** — rare longevity = trusted voice
3. **Multi-language site (6 languages)** — can drive traffic from multiple markets simultaneously
4. **Interactive comparison tool already features them** — they benefit even before affiliate deal
5. **High-intent content** — comparison articles target people actively choosing a platform
6. **Existing eToro affiliate = proven converter** — you know how to drive signups

### What to Ask For (in order of priority)
1. **Enhanced CPA rates** above standard entry tiers
2. **Revenue share component** for long-term recurring income
3. **Dedicated affiliate manager** for optimisation support
4. **Exclusive promotional offers** for your audience (gives you a USP over other creators)
5. **Content support** — data, quotes, early access to features

### Key Negotiation Tips
- Don't accept the first offer — published rates are starting points
- Ask for a "trial period" at premium rates to prove your value
- Mention other platforms you're in discussions with (creates urgency)
- Offer exclusivity windows in exchange for better rates (e.g., "I'll feature X prominently for 3 months")
- Ask for unique promo codes — these help track your performance AND give you negotiating data
