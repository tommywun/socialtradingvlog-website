# eToro vs Competitors: Detailed Research Notes for Comparison Articles
## For socialtradingvlog.com

**Important note:** The data below is based on my knowledge through early-to-mid 2025. Before publishing, verify current fee schedules directly on each platform's website, as brokers frequently adjust spreads, minimums, and fee structures. I have flagged specific items that are most likely to change.

## KEY EDITORIAL ANGLES FOR EACH ARTICLE

### Overarching Narrative
You have a unique angle: 10 years on eToro gives you genuine authority. Each article should:
1. Open with a personal anecdote about eToro
2. Explain WHY you tested the competitor (what gap were you trying to fill?)
3. Be genuinely balanced -- eToro fans will trust you more if you admit where eToro falls short
4. End with a clear recommendation based on USER TYPE, not a single winner

### Article-Specific Angles

**eToro vs Plus500:** "The CFD Trader's Dilemma" -- Plus500 is simpler and has guaranteed stops, but eToro does everything Plus500 does AND more. Plus500 only wins for pure CFD traders who don't want distractions.

**eToro vs Trading 212:** "The Fee Fighter" -- This is the cost comparison. Trading 212 is genuinely cheaper on almost every fee metric. The question is whether eToro's copy trading and crypto justify the higher costs. The ISA angle is massive for UK readers.

**eToro vs DEGIRO:** "The Investor vs The Social Trader" -- These platforms serve completely different users. DEGIRO is for serious investors who want global exchange access. eToro is for social traders who want community. Minimal overlap.

**eToro vs Interactive Brokers:** "When You Outgrow eToro" -- This is the graduation story. IBKR is where serious traders/investors eventually land. The currency conversion difference alone (0.5% vs 0.002%) is a bombshell for anyone trading significant volumes.

**eToro vs XTB:** "The Platform Quality Battle" -- xStation 5 vs eToro's web trader. Both are strong all-rounders, but XTB has better forex spreads and platform quality, while eToro has copy trading and real crypto.

---

## ITEMS TO VERIFY BEFORE PUBLISHING

These are the data points most likely to have changed and should be confirmed directly on each platform's website:

1. **Plus500:** Current minimum deposit by region; whether they've added any non-CFD products
2. **Trading 212:** Current crypto availability; interest rate on cash; whether they've added copy trading features
3. **DEGIRO:** Whether they now offer fractional shares; current UK availability status; exact commission structure post-2024 updates
4. **IBKR:** Current IBKR Lite availability outside US; crypto availability by region; current margin rates
5. **XTB:** Whether they've launched copy trading; current crypto offering (CFD vs real); interest rates on cash by jurisdiction
6. **eToro:** Current minimum deposit by region; any fee changes; current number of available assets
7. **All platforms:** Verify exact spread figures by opening demo accounts and checking live spreads on EUR/USD, Apple stock, and Bitcoin
8. **Regulatory changes:** Check if any platform has gained or lost regulatory licenses since mid-2025
