# eToro Affiliate Content Calendar for socialtradingvlog.com

## Priority Order (Highest Intent + Easiest to Rank First)

---

### PRIORITY 1: "eToro minimum deposit" / "how much money do you need for eToro"

**Rationale for top priority:** These two keywords target the exact same intent (bottom-of-funnel, transactional). Searchers are on the verge of signing up. Combined volume is strong, and a single article can rank for both.

**Who typically ranks:** eToro's own help pages, broker review sites (BrokerChooser, Investopedia, ForexBrokers.com), and a scattering of smaller niche affiliate sites. eToro's own page is thin -- typically just a table of minimums by country.

**Content gap analysis:**
- Most pages give a flat table of minimums by country and stop there. They don't explain *why* you might want to deposit more than the minimum, what happens if you deposit exactly the minimum (limited diversification, can't copy trade properly, etc.), or how the minimum has changed over time.
- Almost nobody discusses the practical experience: "I deposited $200 -- here's what I could actually do with it vs. depositing $1,000."
- No one addresses the follow-up questions in the same article: payment methods, processing times, currency conversion fees on the deposit itself.

**Recommended article title:**
*eToro Minimum Deposit in 2026: How Much Do You Actually Need? (10 Years of Experience)*

**Recommended structure:**
- H2: What Is eToro's Minimum Deposit in 2026? (Country-by-Country Table)
- H2: How eToro's Minimum Deposit Has Changed Over the Years
- H2: Minimum Deposit vs. Practical Minimum -- What I Recommend After 10 Years
- H2: Minimum Deposit for Copy Trading (It's Different)

- H2: What Can You Actually Do With $50 / $200 / $500 / $1,000?
- H2: How to Make Your First Deposit (Step-by-Step With Screenshots)
- H2: FAQ

**Word count target:** 2,000 - 2,500 words

**Difficulty:** Low-medium. Informational with transactional sub-intent. Large review sites rank but don't go deep.

---

### PRIORITY 2: "eToro withdrawal fees"

**Rationale:** High commercial intent. People searching this are either current users frustrated by fees or prospective users doing due diligence. Affiliate conversion potential is moderate (they may already have accounts), but this builds trust and topical authority.

**Who typically ranks:** eToro's own fee page, BrokerChooser, Investopedia, smaller forex/broker review sites, and some YouTube videos.

**Content gap analysis:**
- Most articles state the $5 withdrawal fee and stop. They don't explain the *total cost* of withdrawal (conversion fee + withdrawal fee + potential bank charges).
- Nobody walks through the actual withdrawal screen with screenshots.
- No one discusses strategies to minimize withdrawal costs (withdraw larger amounts less frequently, use specific payment methods, etc.).
- Almost no first-person perspective: "Here's what my actual withdrawal cost breakdown looked like."

**Recommended article title:**
*eToro Withdrawal Fees Explained: The Real Cost of Taking Your Money Out (2026)*

**Recommended structure:**
- H2: eToro's Official Withdrawal Fee ($5)
- H2: The Hidden Cost Most People Miss: Currency Conversion

- H2: How to Minimize Your Withdrawal Costs (My Strategy After 10 Years)
- H2: eToro Withdrawal Fees vs. Competitors (Quick Comparison Table)
- H2: Common Withdrawal Problems and How to Fix Them
- H2: FAQ

**Word count target:** 1,800 - 2,200 words

**Difficulty:** Low-medium. Informational keyword. Thin competition outside the big review sites.

---

### PRIORITY 3: "eToro spread fees explained"

**Rationale:** This is the single most confusing fee topic for eToro users. Searchers need education, which means they'll spend time on the page (good engagement signals). Strong opportunity to build authority.

**Who typically ranks:** eToro's own spread page, BrokerChooser, a few forex comparison sites. Most content is dry tables of spread numbers.

**Content gap analysis:**
- Almost nobody *actually explains* what a spread is in plain language, then shows how it applies to eToro specifically.
- No one provides real trade examples: "I bought $500 of Apple stock -- here's exactly what the spread cost me."
- Nobody compares eToro spreads to commission-based brokers in a way that helps beginners understand the total cost.
- Missing: how spreads vary by asset class, time of day, market conditions.

**Recommended article title:**
*eToro Spread Fees Explained Simply: What You're Really Paying (With Real Examples)*

**Recommended structure:**
- H2: What Is a Spread? (Explained Like You're 10)
- H2: How eToro's Spread Model Works
- H2: eToro Spreads by Asset Class (Stocks, Crypto, Forex, Commodities, ETFs)
- H2: Real Trade Examples: What I Actually Paid in Spreads

- H2: When Spreads Are Wider (And When to Avoid Trading)
- H2: How to Check the Spread Before You Trade on eToro
- H2: Tips to Minimize Spread Costs
- H2: FAQ

**Word count target:** 2,200 - 2,800 words

**Difficulty:** Medium. Requires genuine expertise to write well, which is an advantage for socialtradingvlog.com.

---

### PRIORITY 4: "is eToro safe"

**Rationale:** Massive search volume. Bottom-of-funnel trust query. Searchers are close to signing up but need reassurance. High affiliate conversion potential.

**Who typically ranks:** Major review sites (Investopedia, NerdWallet, BrokerChooser, ForexBrokers.com), eToro's own "About" and regulation pages, Reddit threads, Trustpilot.

**Content gap analysis:**
- Big review sites give a regulatory overview (FCA, CySEC, ASIC, etc.) but it reads like a compliance document.
- Nobody gives a personal perspective: "I've had money on eToro for 10 years -- here's my actual experience with safety."
- Missing: What happens if eToro goes bankrupt? What's the investor compensation scheme? How does eToro's insurance work in practice?
- No one addresses the *emotional* side of the query: people are scared. They need a human being to tell them it's okay (or warn them about real risks).

**Recommended article title:**
*Is eToro Safe? My Honest Assessment After 10 Years and $XX,XXX Invested*

**Recommended structure:**
- H2: The Short Answer (Is eToro Safe?)
- H2: eToro's Regulatory Status in 2026 (Country by Country)
- H2: What Happens to Your Money if eToro Goes Bankrupt?
- H2: Investor Compensation Schemes That Protect You

- H2: What Are the Actual Risks of Using eToro?
- H2: eToro Safety vs. Other Brokers
- H2: FAQ

**Word count target:** 2,500 - 3,000 words

**Difficulty:** High. Competing against DR90+ sites. But the personal experience angle is a genuine differentiator that big sites cannot replicate.

---

### PRIORITY 5: "eToro copy trading fees"

**Rationale:** Directly aligned with socialtradingvlog.com's core topic (social trading). This should be a cornerstone article.

**Who typically ranks:** eToro's own copy trading page, BrokerChooser, Investopedia, a few niche copy trading review sites.

**Content gap analysis:**
- eToro's official messaging is "copy trading is free" -- which is technically true (no management fee), but misleading. Spreads still apply. Overnight fees still apply.
- Almost no one breaks down the *true total cost* of copy trading vs. manually executing the same trades.
- Nobody shows real portfolio examples: "I copied Trader X for 6 months. Here's what I paid in total fees."
- Missing: how the $200 copy minimum interacts with the number of positions the copied trader opens.

**Recommended article title:**
*eToro Copy Trading Fees: What "Free" Actually Costs You (Real Numbers From My Portfolio)*

**Recommended structure:**
- H2: Is Copy Trading on eToro Really Free?
- H2: The Fees You Still Pay When Copy Trading

- H2: Copy Trading vs. Smart Portfolios: Fee Comparison
- H2: How to Minimize Copy Trading Costs
- H2: FAQ

**Word count target:** 2,000 - 2,500 words

**Difficulty:** Low-medium. This is socialtradingvlog.com's home turf. Few competitors have real copy trading experience.

---

### PRIORITY 6: "eToro copy trading review"

**Rationale:** Core topic for the site. Review-intent keyword with high affiliate conversion potential. This should be the definitive resource.

**Who typically ranks:** Investopedia, BrokerChooser, YouTube videos, some niche review sites. Mixed content types (written reviews, video reviews, comparison articles).

**Content gap analysis:**
- Most reviews are surface-level: "eToro lets you copy other traders. Here's how it works." Written by people who've clearly never used it seriously.
- Nobody provides long-term performance data from their own copy trading portfolio.
- Missing: honest discussion of the risks (copied traders can blow up, allocation issues, the temptation to keep swapping traders).
- No one discusses the evolution of eToro's copy trading feature over time.

**Recommended article title:**
*eToro Copy Trading Review 2026: 10 Years of Copying Traders (Honest Results)*

**Recommended structure:**
- H2: What Is eToro Copy Trading? (Quick Overview)

- H2: How to Choose Traders to Copy (My Criteria)
- H2: eToro Copy Trading vs. Alternatives (ZuluTrade, NAGA, etc.)
- H2: Tips From 10 Years of Copy Trading
- H2: FAQ

**Word count target:** 3,000 - 4,000 words

**Difficulty:** Medium-high. Competitive keyword but the personal authority angle is very strong.

---

### PRIORITY 7: "best traders to copy on eToro"

**Rationale:** Extremely high intent for eToro users. People searching this are ready to allocate money. Directly relevant to socialtradingvlog.com's expertise.

**Who typically ranks:** eToro's own "Discover" page, a handful of niche sites with "top 10" lists, YouTube videos, Reddit threads. Content quality is generally poor -- most lists are just screenshots of eToro's leaderboard with no analysis.

**Content gap analysis:**
- Most articles just list traders with high recent returns. No methodology for selection.
- Nobody explains the critical metrics: risk score, drawdown, consistency, how long they've been trading, what happens when markets turn.
- Missing: warnings about survivorship bias, what to look for to *avoid*, red flags in trader profiles.
- No one updates their lists or shows long-term follow-up performance.

**Recommended article title:**
*Best Traders to Copy on eToro in 2026: My Selection Criteria After 10 Years*

**Recommended structure:**
- H2: Why Most "Best Traders" Lists Are Useless
- H2: My Criteria for Selecting Traders to Copy
- H2: Key Metrics to Analyze (And What They Really Mean)
- H2: Red Flags to Watch For in a Trader's Profile

- H2: How to Build a Diversified Copy Trading Portfolio
- H2: How Often Should You Review Your Copied Traders?
- H2: Common Mistakes When Choosing Traders to Copy
- H2: FAQ

**Word count target:** 2,500 - 3,500 words (needs regular updates)

**Difficulty:** Medium. Lower DR sites can rank here because big review sites don't invest in this specific topic. Requires ongoing maintenance.

---

### PRIORITY 8: "how to close eToro account"

**Rationale:** Navigational/how-to intent. Low affiliate potential (user is leaving eToro), but strong for topical authority and trust. Also captures "win-back" traffic -- some people searching this are frustrated but persuadable.

**Who typically ranks:** eToro's own help center, how-to/tech sites (WikiHow-style), a few broker review sites.

**Content gap analysis:**
- eToro's own help page is deliberately obtuse (they don't make it easy).
- Third-party guides are step-by-step but don't address the *reasons* someone might want to close their account and potential alternatives.
- Nobody discusses: what happens to pending trades, tax implications of closing, how to download your data first, how long the process actually takes.

**Recommended article title:**
*How to Close Your eToro Account (And What to Do Before You Hit Delete)*

**Recommended structure:**
- H2: Before You Close: Things to Consider
- H2: How to Withdraw All Your Funds First
- H2: Step-by-Step: How to Close Your eToro Account

- H2: Can You Reopen a Closed eToro Account?
- H2: Alternatives to Closing (Deactivation, Reducing Activity)
- H2: FAQ

**Word count target:** 1,500 - 1,800 words

**Difficulty:** Low. Straightforward how-to content. Easy to rank with a thorough article.

---

### PRIORITY 9: "eToro vs Trading 212"

**Rationale:** Comparison keyword with strong commercial intent. Both platforms are popular in the UK/Europe. Searchers are deciding between the two.

**Who typically ranks:** Broker comparison sites (BrokerChooser, InvestingReviews, MoneyCheck), YouTube comparison videos, a few niche finance sites.

**Content gap analysis:**
- Most comparisons are feature-table driven: side-by-side specs without personal opinion.
- Nobody gives a "I've used both -- here's what I actually prefer and why" perspective.
- Missing: specific use-case recommendations (which is better for beginners, for copy trading, for stocks, for crypto, for ISA investing).
- No one discusses the deal-breakers (e.g., Trading 212's interest on uninvested cash vs. eToro's social features).

**Recommended article title:**
*eToro vs Trading 212 (2026): Which Should You Choose? (I've Used Both)*

**Recommended structure:**

- H2: My Recommendation
- H2: FAQ

**Word count target:** 2,500 - 3,000 words

**Difficulty:** Medium-high. Competitive comparison keyword. Established review sites dominate but a first-person perspective is a real differentiator.

---

### PRIORITY 10: (Bonus -- Combine) "how much money do you need for eToro"

**Covered by Priority 1.** This keyword should be targeted by the same article as "eToro minimum deposit." Use this as a secondary keyword in the title tag, meta description, and an H2 heading. No separate article needed.

---

## Key Competitive Advantage for socialtradingvlog.com

The single biggest differentiator across all 9 articles is **authentic, first-person experience over 10 years**. The top-ranking sites (Investopedia, BrokerChooser, NerdWallet) produce generic broker reviews written by staff writers who often have never used the platforms. Google's Helpful Content guidelines and E-E-A-T framework increasingly reward:

1. **Experience** -- actual screenshots from your own account, real P&L numbers, real withdrawal receipts
2. **Specificity** -- "When I deposited $200 in 2016, here's what happened" beats "The minimum deposit is $200"
3. **Honesty** -- acknowledging eToro's weaknesses (spreads are wider than some competitors, the $5 withdrawal fee is annoying) builds trust and keeps people on the page

Every article should include at least one personal screenshot, one real-money example, and one honest negative. This is what the big sites *cannot* do and what Google increasingly rewards.

## Important Caveat

**This analysis is based on my training data and general SEO knowledge, not live SERP data.** Before executing this calendar, I strongly recommend:

1. **Verify search volumes** using Ahrefs or SEMrush for each keyword
2. **Check current SERPs** manually to confirm the competitive landscape hasn't shifted
3. **Audit socialtradingvlog.com** to identify existing content that may already cover some of these topics (to avoid cannibalisation)
4. **Check eToro's current fee structure** as minimums, withdrawal fees, and spreads change periodically

If you can grant WebSearch or WebFetch permissions, I can re-run this analysis with live data to validate and refine these recommendations.
