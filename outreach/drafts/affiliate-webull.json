  "body": "Hi Johnson,\n\nThanks for your message about the ISA launch — and for your persistence over the past few months! I apologise for not getting back sooner.\n\nI've been doing a lot of work behind the scenes building out my website and content strategy, and I think the timing is now right to explore working together properly.\n\nSince you first reached out, here's where things stand:\n\n- YouTube: 66,400+ subscribers, 4.5 million total views across 335 videos\n- Top video: 826,000+ views\n- Website: socialtradingvlog.com — now features interactive comparison tools, educational guides, and SEO-optimised content\n- Multi-language: full site in 6 languages (English, Spanish, German, French, Portuguese, Arabic)\n- I've just built an interactive platform comparison tool where I compare trading platforms side by side\n\nYour ISA launch timing is perfect — my UK audience will be looking at ISA options as the new tax year approaches.\n\nI'd be very interested in discussing:\n\n1. Adding Webull UK to my platform comparison tool (socialtradingvlog.com/calculators/compare-platforms/) — this gets continuous organic search traffic\n2. A dedicated Webull UK review and comparison article\n3. Featuring Webull in relevant YouTube videos\n\nIn terms of the partnership model, I'd like to understand:\n- What CPA or revenue share rates you offer for content creators in my size bracket\n- Whether there's a premium or long-term partner programme (you mentioned a 'customised collaboration model' in a previous email)\n- What the commission structure looks like for ISA account signups specifically\n\nI'm based in Malta and flexible on call times. Happy to discuss further.\n\nBest regards,\nTom West\nSocial Trading Vlog\nhttps://socialtradingvlog.com\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@SocialTradingVlog"
