  "body": "Hi Benzinga team,\n\nI'm Tom from Social Trading Vlog. I've been using eToro's copy trading feature with real money since 2016 — nearly 10 years — documenting everything on YouTube (335 videos) and socialtradingvlog.com.\n\nI'd like to contribute an article:\n\n\"eToro Copy Trading: A Nearly 10-Year Performance Review with Real Numbers\"\n\nThis would include:\n\n- My actual annualised returns over nearly a decade\n- Breakdown of fees, spreads, and hidden costs\n- How different market conditions (COVID crash, 2022 bear, 2024-25 bull) affected copy trading portfolios\n- Honest pros and cons from someone who has no affiliation with eToro beyond being a user\n\nMy content stands out because it's based on documented, real experience — not affiliate-driven reviews or theory. I have nearly 10 years of video evidence to back everything up.\n\nInterested? I can send a full draft or outline.\n\nBest,\nTom\nSocial Trading Vlog\nhttps://socialtradingvlog.com"
