  "body": "Hi Seeking Alpha team,\n\nI'd like to apply as a contributor. I'm Tom from Social Trading Vlog — I've been copy trading on eToro since 2016, nearly 10 years, with real money, documenting everything across 335 YouTube videos and my website socialtradingvlog.com.\n\nProposed first article:\n\n\"Analysing eToro's Top Traders: What Separates Consistent Performers from Flash-in-the-Pan Returns\"\n\nI'd analyse the characteristics of top-performing Popular Investors on eToro using real data from my nearly 10 years on the platform, covering:\n\n- Risk score patterns and what they actually mean for copiers\n- Why high short-term returns are often a red flag\n- The role of drawdown history in predicting future performance\n- How eToro's Popular Investor incentive structure affects trader behaviour\n\nMy background: UK expat based in Malta, copy trading on eToro since 2016. I'm not a financial adviser — I'm a real user sharing documented experience, which I believe is exactly what readers are looking for.\n\nHappy to discuss article ideas or submit a full draft.\n\nBest regards,\nTom\nSocial Trading Vlog\nhttps://socialtradingvlog.com\nhttps://youtube.com/socialtrading"
