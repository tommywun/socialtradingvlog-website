  "body": "Hi Finance Magnates team,\n\nI'm Tom from Social Trading Vlog. I've been copy trading on eToro since 2016 — nearly 10 years — and have documented the entire journey across 335 YouTube videos and my website socialtradingvlog.com.\n\nI'd like to contribute an article:\n\n\"The Evolution of Social Trading: One User's Nearly 10-Year Journey on eToro\"\n\nThis would cover:\n\n- How eToro's copy trading features have changed since 2016\n- The real impact of the Popular Investor programme on trader behaviour\n- What retail copiers actually experience vs what the marketing promises\n- Lessons from copying traders through COVID, the 2022 bear market, and the 2024-25 bull run\n\nI'm not a financial adviser — just a real user with nearly a decade of documented experience. I think your readers would find an honest, long-term perspective valuable.\n\nHappy to send a draft or outline.\n\nBest,\nTom\nSocial Trading Vlog\nhttps://socialtradingvlog.com\nhttps://youtube.com/@SocialTradingVlog"
