  "body": "Hi,\n\nI'm Tom from Social Trading Vlog. I've been copy trading on eToro since 2016 and have 335 YouTube videos documenting the journey.\n\nI'd love to be a guest on Trading Nut. My angle:\n\n- Nearly 10 years of real-money copy trading, filmed and documented\n- The psychology of trusting someone else with your money\n- What separates traders worth copying from the ones who look good on paper but blow up\n- Honest talk about whether copy trading can work as a long-term strategy\n\nI'm not selling anything — just sharing nearly a decade of real experience. Happy to chat about format and topics.\n\nCheers,\nTom\nSocial Trading Vlog\nhttps://socialtradingvlog.com\nhttps://youtube.com/socialtrading"
