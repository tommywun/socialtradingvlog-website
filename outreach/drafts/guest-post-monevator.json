  "body": "Hi,\n\nI'm Tom from Social Trading Vlog. I've been copy trading on eToro since 2016 — nearly 10 years — documenting everything across 335 YouTube videos and my website socialtradingvlog.com.\n\nI'd love to write a guest post for Monevator on the topic:\n\n\"Copy Trading vs Index Funds: What Nearly 10 Years of Real-Money Data Taught Me\"\n\nUnlike most copy trading content, my perspective comes from nearly a decade of documented, real results — not theory or affiliate-driven reviews. I can share:\n\n- Actual annualised returns compared to a simple index fund benchmark\n- The real costs (spreads, overnight fees, currency conversion) that most articles ignore\n- Lessons from multiple major drawdowns (COVID crash, 2022 bear market, and more)\n- Whether I'd recommend it as part of a diversified portfolio\n\nThe tone would match Monevator's evidence-based, no-hype style. I'm a UK expat living in Malta, so I can also cover the EU regulatory angle.\n\nHappy to share an outline or draft first. Thanks for considering!\n\nBest,\nTom\nSocial Trading Vlog\nhttps://socialtradingvlog.com"
