  "body": "Hi BabyPips team,\n\nI'm Tom, and I've been copy trading on eToro since 2016 — nearly 10 years. I've documented the entire journey across 335 YouTube videos on my channel Social Trading Vlog, and recently launched socialtradingvlog.com with detailed guides.\n\nI'd love to contribute a guest post:\n\n\"From Forex to Social Trading: Lessons from Nearly 10 Years of Real Copy Trading\"\n\nKey points I'd cover:\n\n- How to evaluate traders to copy (the metrics that actually matter vs vanity stats)\n- Common mistakes I made in my early years and how I fixed them\n- Why 76% of eToro traders lose money — and what the other 24% do differently\n- Realistic expectations: what copy trading can and can't do\n\nI have real performance data, screenshots, and specific examples. This isn't a theoretical piece — it's from someone who's been doing it with real money since 2016.\n\nWould you be interested? Happy to send an outline or full draft.\n\nCheers,\nTom\nSocial Trading Vlog\nhttps://socialtradingvlog.com"
