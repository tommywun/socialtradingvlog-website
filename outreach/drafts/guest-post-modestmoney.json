  "body": "Hi Jeremy,\n\nI'm Tom from Social Trading Vlog. I've been copy trading on eToro since 2016 and have documented the whole journey across 335 YouTube videos and socialtradingvlog.com.\n\nI'd love to write a guest post for Modest Money:\n\n\"Copy Trading on eToro: An Honest Review After Nearly 10 Years\"\n\nI'd cover:\n\n- The hidden costs most reviews don't mention (spreads, overnight fees, currency conversion)\n- How to evaluate which traders to copy (and the red flags to watch for)\n- Common beginner mistakes I made and how to avoid them\n- Whether copy trading is worth it as a hands-off investing approach\n\nThis isn't a theoretical piece — it's based on nearly a decade of real-money experience with video evidence to back it up. Happy to match your editorial style.\n\nLet me know if you're interested!\n\nCheers,\nTom\nSocial Trading Vlog\nhttps://socialtradingvlog.com"
