  "body": "Hi Blockonomi team,\n\nI'm Tom from Social Trading Vlog. I've been copy trading on eToro since 2016 — nearly 10 years — documenting everything across 335 YouTube videos and socialtradingvlog.com.\n\nI'd like to contribute a guest post:\n\n\"eToro Copy Trading: What Nearly 10 Years of Real Experience Actually Looks Like\"\n\nI'd cover:\n\n- How to pick traders to copy (beyond the stats eToro shows you)\n- The real fees and costs that eat into copy trading returns\n- How different market conditions affect copy trading portfolios\n- My honest assessment after nearly a decade on the platform\n\nI noticed you already cover eToro on your site. My perspective as a long-term real user could complement your existing reviews well.\n\nHappy to send an outline or full draft.\n\nBest,\nTom\nSocial Trading Vlog\nhttps://socialtradingvlog.com"
