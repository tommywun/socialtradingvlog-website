  "body": "Hi Aaron,\n\nI'm Tom from Social Trading Vlog. I've been copy trading on eToro since 2016 — nearly 10 years — and have documented the entire journey across 335 YouTube videos.\n\nI think my story could make an interesting episode for Chat With Traders:\n\n- I started on eToro in 2016 and have stuck with copy trading through every market cycle since\n- I've made every mistake in the book and learned from them on camera\n- I have a unique perspective on what makes some copy traders consistently profitable vs those who blow up\n- I can talk honestly about the realities of social trading — the good, the bad, and the ugly\n\nMy angle is different from most trading guests because I'm not selling a course or a system — I'm just a regular guy who's been doing this for nearly a decade and documenting it all.\n\nWould love to chat if you think it's a fit.\n\nBest,\nTom\nSocial Trading Vlog\nhttps://socialtradingvlog.com\nhttps://youtube.com/socialtrading"
