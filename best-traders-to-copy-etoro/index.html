        <p class="article-intro">I&#x27;ve been using eToro since 2016. In that time I&#x27;ve copied dozens of traders, watched some deliver brilliant long-term returns, and watched others blow up spectacularly. The one thing I&#x27;ve learned above all else: the &quot;best&quot; traders to copy are almost never the ones at the top of the leaderboard. This guide isn&#x27;t a list of names to copy. Names go stale within weeks. Instead, I&#x27;m going to share the exact criteria and methodology I use to find, evaluate, and select traders to copy on eToro — the same approach I&#x27;ve refined over nearly a decade of doing this.

        <h2 id="why-lists-useless">Why Most &quot;Best Traders&quot; Lists Are Useless</h2>

        <p>Let me be blunt: most articles titled &quot;best traders to copy on eToro&quot; are garbage. They typically show you a list of 5-10 traders who had the highest returns over the last 6-12 months. Looks impressive. The problem is that these lists are riddled with <strong>survivorship bias</strong> — you&#x27;re only seeing the winners. You&#x27;re not seeing the hundreds of traders who took identical risks and blew up.</p>

        <p>I&#x27;ve seen this play out countless times over 10 years. A trader posts 200% returns in a year. They get featured on every blog. Thousands of people pile in and start copying. Then the market turns, or their leveraged positions go wrong, and the same trader loses 60% the following quarter. By the time those &quot;best traders&quot; articles get updated, half their readers have already lost significant money.</p>

        <p>The trader who made 200% last year almost certainly took on enormous risk to do so. High returns and high risk are two sides of the same coin. It&#x27;s not that the trader got lucky — it&#x27;s that the risk hasn&#x27;t materialised <em>yet</em>.</p>

        <p>This is exactly why I won&#x27;t name specific traders in this article. Any name I give you today could be completely irrelevant — or worse, dangerous — in six months. What I <em>can</em> give you is something far more valuable: a repeatable framework for finding good traders yourself. A framework that works whether you&#x27;re reading this in 2026 or 2030.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">I&#x27;ll be honest — in my early years on eToro, I fell for the leaderboard trap too. I copied traders purely because they had the highest recent returns. It cost me. That experience is a big part of why I eventually developed the criteria I use today.</p>

        <h2 id="my-criteria">My Criteria for Selecting Traders to Copy (After 10 Years)</h2>

        <p>After nearly 10 years of copy trading, I&#x27;ve narrowed my selection process down to seven criteria. Not every trader I copy ticks every single box — real life is messy — but if a trader fails on more than one or two of these, I move on. Here&#x27;s the checklist I actually use:</p>

        <h3>1. At Least 2 Years of Trading History on eToro</h3>

        <p>This is non-negotiable for me. Anyone can have a great six months. Anyone can have a great year. But two full years of data gives you enough information to see how a trader performs across different market conditions — bull runs, corrections, sideways markets, and periods of high volatility. If a trader only has 12 months of history, you&#x27;re essentially guessing about how they&#x27;ll handle adversity.</p>

        <p>eToro lets you filter by time period on each trader&#x27;s profile. Use it. Look at their monthly returns across multiple years. You want to see a pattern, not a single hot streak.</p>

        <h3>2. Risk Score of 4 or Below (Out of 10)</h3>

        <p>eToro assigns every trader a <a href="../etoro-risk-score-explained/">risk score from 1 to 10</a>. I generally won&#x27;t copy anyone with a risk score above 4. That might sound conservative, but I&#x27;ve learned the hard way that higher risk scores can lead to devastating drawdowns. A risk score of 5-6 <em>might</em> be acceptable in certain cases, but anything above 6 is a firm no from me.</p>

        <p>I&#x27;ll dig deeper into what the risk score actually measures in the metrics section below. For now, just know that if you see a trader with stunning returns and a risk score of 7, 8, or 9, those returns came at a price that will likely become apparent at the worst possible moment.</p>

        <h3>3. Consistent Monthly Returns (Not Huge Spikes and Crashes)</h3>

        <p>I&#x27;d rather copy a trader who returns 1-2% per month fairly consistently than one who returns 30% one month and loses 20% the next. Consistency is more important than magnitude. Look at the monthly return chart on a trader&#x27;s profile — it should look like a relatively steady upward slope, not a rollercoaster.</p>

        <p>Why? Because emotional discipline is harder than people think. When a trader you&#x27;re copying drops 15% in a month, the temptation to stop copying is enormous. And if you stop copying at the bottom, you lock in that loss and miss the recovery. Consistent traders make this much easier to handle psychologically.</p>

        <h3>4. Maximum Drawdown Under 20%</h3>

        <p>Maximum drawdown tells you the biggest peak-to-trough loss a trader has experienced. Under 20% is my threshold. If a trader has had a drawdown of 30%, 40%, or more, that means at some point their copiers sat there watching a third or more of their allocated money evaporate. Could you handle that without panicking? Most people can&#x27;t.</p>

        <p>A max drawdown under 20% suggests the trader has risk management processes in place. It doesn&#x27;t guarantee future performance — nothing does — but it&#x27;s a reasonable baseline.</p>

        <h3>5. Trades Real Assets (Not Just CFDs with Leverage)</h3>

        <p>I strongly prefer traders who primarily trade real stocks and ETFs rather than heavily leveraged CFD positions. Real asset ownership means you actually own the underlying shares. There are no overnight fees eating into returns, and the risk profile is fundamentally different from leveraged trading.</p>

        <p>You can check this on a trader&#x27;s portfolio page. If their portfolio is dominated by leveraged CFD positions, that&#x27;s a significant risk factor. Some CFD trading is fine — but if <em>everything</em> is leveraged, that tells you something about their approach to risk.</p>

        <h3>6. Has Their Own Money Invested (Skin in the Game)</h3>

        <p>This one matters more than most people realise. A trader who has a substantial amount of their own money in their eToro account is much more motivated to manage risk carefully than someone trading with a virtual portfolio or a tiny balance. When a trader&#x27;s own money is on the line, their incentives are aligned with yours.</p>

        <p>eToro&#x27;s Popular Investor programme requires different levels of equity depending on the tier. Higher-tier Popular Investors generally have more skin in the game. This isn&#x27;t a perfect signal, but it&#x27;s a useful one.</p>

        <h3>7. Communicates with Copiers (Posts Updates)</h3>

        <p>A good trader communicates. They post on their eToro feed explaining their trades, their market outlook, and — critically — what they&#x27;re doing when things go wrong. If a trader&#x27;s feed is silent, you have no idea what&#x27;s going on in their head. Are they on holiday? Have they abandoned the strategy? Are they panicking?</p>

        <p>I look for traders who post at least a couple of times per month. It doesn&#x27;t have to be daily. But regular updates show professionalism and respect for the people who are trusting them with their money.</p>

        <div class="risk-warning">
          <strong>Remember</strong>
          Even a trader who ticks every box on this list can lose money. Past performance is not a guarantee of future returns. Copy trading involves risk, and you should never invest more than you can afford to lose. 51% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with eToro.
        </div>

        <h2 id="key-metrics">Key Metrics to Analyse (And What They Really Mean)</h2>

        <p>eToro gives you a lot of data on each trader. The problem is that most people don&#x27;t know how to interpret it — or they focus on the wrong numbers. Here&#x27;s my breakdown of the metrics that actually matter, and what to look for in each one.</p>

        <h3>Risk Score (1-10)</h3>

        <p>eToro&#x27;s <a href="../etoro-risk-score-explained/">risk score</a> is calculated based on the trader&#x27;s portfolio composition, leverage usage, and the volatility of their positions. It&#x27;s recalculated daily. Here&#x27;s a rough guide to what the numbers mean in practice:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>1-2:</strong> Very conservative. Usually holding mostly blue-chip stocks or ETFs with no leverage. Returns will be modest but steady. Think single-digit annual returns in a normal year.</li>
          <li><strong>3-4:</strong> Moderate. A mix of stocks, potentially some riskier positions, but generally well-managed. This is the range I target for most of my copy trading portfolio.</li>
          <li><strong>5-6:</strong> Elevated risk. The trader is likely using some leverage, holding more volatile assets, or concentrating positions. Returns can be higher but so can drawdowns.</li>
          <li><strong>7-8:</strong> High risk. Significant leverage, concentrated bets, or highly volatile assets. I avoid this range entirely.</li>
          <li><strong>9-10:</strong> Extremely high risk. The trader is essentially gambling. A risk score this high usually means heavy leverage on volatile assets. Avoid.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The sweet spot for most copy traders is <strong>3-5</strong>. This range gives you exposure to meaningful returns without the stomach-churning drawdowns that come with higher risk scores. I personally lean towards the 3-4 range, but I acknowledge this is partly a reflection of my own risk tolerance after being burned in the past.</p>

        <h3>Maximum Drawdown</h3>

        <p>Max drawdown is arguably the most important risk metric, and it&#x27;s the one most people skip past to look at total returns. It tells you the biggest loss from a peak to the lowest point before a recovery. If a trader&#x27;s max drawdown is 35%, that means at some point, someone who copied them at the peak saw their investment drop by more than a third.</p>

        <p>My rule: <strong>under 20% is acceptable</strong>. Under 15% is excellent. Under 10% is outstanding (but usually means very conservative returns to match). Over 25% is a red flag. Over 40% is an absolute deal-breaker regardless of what the total return number says.</p>

        <p>When evaluating drawdown, make sure you&#x27;re looking at a long enough time period. A trader with only 12 months of history might show a low max drawdown simply because they haven&#x27;t been through a real market crash yet.</p>

        <h3>Profitable Months</h3>

        <p>This metric shows the percentage of months where the trader posted a positive return. I look for <strong>60% or higher over at least 2 years</strong>. That means in any given year, roughly 7-8 months are profitable and 4-5 are not. That&#x27;s realistic. Anyone claiming 90%+ profitable months over a long period is either very conservative (expect low returns) or hasn&#x27;t been through enough market cycles.</p>

        <p>The key here is the time frame. A 90% profitable month rate over 6 months tells you almost nothing. A 65% rate over 3 years tells you a lot. Always extend the time period to the maximum available.</p>

        <h3>Average Trade Duration</h3>

        <p>This tells you the trader&#x27;s style:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Under a day:</strong> Day trader. High frequency, lots of small positions opened and closed quickly. Generates more spread costs and is harder to replicate accurately via copy trading (there can be slippage).</li>
          <li><strong>Days to weeks:</strong> Swing trader. Medium-term positions based on technical analysis or short-term trends.</li>
          <li><strong>Weeks to months:</strong> Position trader. Longer-term holds, often fundamentals-based.</li>
          <li><strong>Months to years:</strong> Long-term investor. Buy-and-hold approach, lower turnover, fewer fees.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I generally prefer traders with average durations of weeks to months or longer. They tend to incur fewer <a href="../etoro-fees/">trading fees</a>, and the copy trading mechanism works more reliably for longer-duration trades. Day traders can be profitable, but the copy mechanism isn&#x27;t always fast enough to capture their exact entries and exits.</p>

        <h3>Number of Copiers</h3>

        <p>A high number of copiers is <strong>social proof</strong> — it tells you other people trust this trader. But it can also be a <strong>vanity metric</strong>. Some traders accumulate copiers during a hot streak, and those copiers stick around even after performance declines. A trader with 10,000 copiers isn&#x27;t necessarily better than one with 500 copiers.</p>

        <p>I use copier count as a secondary signal. If a trader meets all my other criteria and also has a healthy copier base, great. But I&#x27;d never copy someone purely because they&#x27;re popular. I&#x27;ve seen popular traders crash just as often as obscure ones.</p>

        <p>What&#x27;s more useful is the <strong>copier trend</strong> — is the number growing, flat, or shrinking? A rapidly shrinking copier count can indicate that existing copiers are losing confidence.</p>

        <h3>Total AUM (Assets Under Management)</h3>

        <p>For Popular Investors — traders in eToro&#x27;s programme who earn income from being copied — the total assets under management figure tells you how much real money is allocated to them. A Popular Investor managing millions of dollars in copier funds has an enormous incentive to be careful. Their income depends on retaining copiers, and their copiers are watching closely.</p>

        <p>High AUM doesn&#x27;t guarantee good performance, but it does suggest the trader takes their responsibility seriously. They know that reckless trading doesn&#x27;t just affect their own account — it affects thousands of people who trusted them.</p>

        <h2 id="red-flags">Red Flags to Watch For in a Trader&#x27;s Profile</h2>

        <p>Over the years I&#x27;ve developed a pretty sharp instinct for spotting trouble. Here are the warning signs that make me close a trader&#x27;s profile and move on immediately — no matter how good the headline returns look.</p>

        <h3>Risk Score Above 6</h3>

        <p>I covered this above, but it bears repeating. A risk score of 7, 8, 9, or 10 is a red flag, full stop. The returns might look spectacular right now, but the underlying risk is enormous. I&#x27;ve watched traders with risk scores of 8+ lose 50% of their value in a single bad week. If you wouldn&#x27;t bet a significant chunk of your savings on a single high-risk trade, don&#x27;t copy someone who does it routinely.</p>

        <h3>Huge Returns in a Short Period</h3>

        <p>If someone has made 150% in the last 6 months, my first reaction isn&#x27;t excitement — it&#x27;s suspicion. Returns that high, that fast, almost always mean the trader is taking outsized risks. They may have concentrated their portfolio in a single volatile asset. They may be using heavy leverage. They may have gotten lucky. None of those things are sustainable.</p>

        <p>The question to ask yourself: &quot;Is this trader so good that they can consistently generate returns that would make professional hedge fund managers jealous? Or is this a short-term anomaly?&quot; The answer is almost always the latter.</p>

        <h3>Inconsistent Returns (Rollercoaster Pattern)</h3>

        <p>Look at the monthly returns chart. If you see massive up months (+20%, +15%) followed by massive down months (-18%, -12%), that&#x27;s a trader who is taking big swings and getting hit by big swings. Even if the net result is positive, the journey is going to be psychologically brutal for you as a copier.</p>

        <p>Consistency matters. A trader who delivers 2% per month reliably will compound to much better long-term returns than one who alternates between +15% and -12%.</p>

        <h3>Heavy Use of Leverage</h3>

        <p>Check the trader&#x27;s open positions. If most of their trades are leveraged CFDs, that&#x27;s a warning sign. Leverage amplifies both gains and losses — it&#x27;s the single fastest way to blow up an account. Some traders use modest leverage on specific positions, and that&#x27;s fine. But a portfolio that&#x27;s predominantly leveraged is a ticking time bomb.</p>

        <p>Also be aware that leveraged positions incur <a href="../etoro-fees/">overnight fees</a>, which eat into returns over time. A trader might show positive returns on paper but be haemorrhaging money in overnight charges that aren&#x27;t immediately obvious from the headline numbers.</p>

        <h3>No Activity on the Feed</h3>

        <p>Silence is a red flag. If a trader hasn&#x27;t posted on their eToro feed in months, it could mean they&#x27;ve lost interest, they&#x27;re distracted, or they simply don&#x27;t care about their copiers. Either way, you&#x27;re flying blind. You have no insight into their thinking, their strategy adjustments, or their plans.</p>

        <p>I&#x27;ve stopped copying traders specifically because they went silent. Not because their returns were bad, but because I no longer had any visibility into what they were doing or why.</p>

        <h3>Very New Account (Under 12 Months)</h3>

        <p>I mentioned this in my criteria section: 2 years is my minimum. But even 12 months should be an absolute floor. A trader with 3-6 months of history is essentially untested. They might be brilliant. They might also be on a beginner&#x27;s luck streak. You simply don&#x27;t have enough data to make an informed decision.</p>

        <h3>Only Trades One Asset Class</h3>

        <p>If a trader exclusively trades crypto, or exclusively trades forex, or exclusively trades tech stocks, that&#x27;s a concentration risk. When that single asset class has a bad period — and every asset class eventually does — the trader&#x27;s performance will crater with no diversification to cushion the blow.</p>

        <p>I prefer traders who spread their positions across at least 2-3 asset classes. It doesn&#x27;t have to be perfectly balanced, but some diversification shows thoughtful portfolio construction.</p>

        <h2 id="diversified-portfolio">How to Build a Diversified Copy Trading Portfolio</h2>

        <p>One of the biggest mistakes I see people make — and one I made myself early on — is putting all their copy trading money on a single trader. Even if that trader is excellent, you&#x27;re concentrating all your risk. If they have a bad quarter, your entire copy trading portfolio has a bad quarter.</p>

        <p>My recommendation: <strong>copy between 5 and 10 traders</strong>, each with a different style or asset focus. I go into this topic in much more detail in my guide on <a href="../how-many-traders-to-copy-etoro/">how many traders to copy on eToro</a>, but here&#x27;s the high-level approach:</p>

        <h3>Diversify Across Trading Styles</h3>

        <p>Don&#x27;t copy 5 traders who all do the same thing. Instead, mix it up:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>1-2 long-term stock investors (low risk, steady returns)</li>
          <li>1-2 swing traders (moderate risk, medium-term positions)</li>
          <li>1 trader focused on ETFs or index-based strategies</li>
          <li>1 trader with a different geographic focus (e.g. European markets vs US markets)</li>
          <li>Optionally, 1 trader with a small allocation to higher-risk, higher-reward strategies — but only if your risk tolerance supports it</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Diversify Across Asset Classes</h3>

        <p>Try to ensure your overall copy portfolio isn&#x27;t 100% exposed to a single market. If all 5 of your copied traders primarily trade US tech stocks, you&#x27;re not really diversified — you&#x27;re just exposed to US tech five times over.</p>

        <p>Look for a mix: some traders focused on stocks, some on ETFs, perhaps one who trades commodities or other markets. The goal is that when one area of the market struggles, other parts of your portfolio hold up.</p>

        <h3>Allocate Based on Risk Tolerance</h3>

        <p>Not every trader in your portfolio should get an equal allocation. I typically allocate more capital to my lower-risk, more consistent traders and less capital to any higher-risk traders I&#x27;m experimenting with.</p>

        <p>For example, you might allocate 25% each to your two most consistent, low-risk traders, 15% each to two moderate-risk traders, and 10% each to two slightly more adventurous picks. The exact split depends on your personal risk tolerance and financial situation.</p>

        <p>Remember that the minimum copy amount on eToro is $200 per trader. So to copy 5 traders you need at least $1,000, and to copy 10 you need at least $2,000. To build a properly diversified portfolio with meaningful allocations, $2,000-$5,000 is a more realistic starting point. I discuss the trade-offs in more detail in my <a href="../how-many-traders-to-copy-etoro/">how many traders to copy</a> guide.</p>

        <h2 id="review-frequency">How Often Should You Review Your Copied Traders?</h2>

        <p>Copy trading is often marketed as &quot;passive investing.&quot; And while it&#x27;s certainly less work than managing your own trades, it&#x27;s not a &quot;set it and forget it&quot; strategy. I do a <strong>monthly check-in</strong> on every trader I&#x27;m copying. It takes about 15-20 minutes, and it&#x27;s well worth it.</p>

        <h3>What to Check Each Month</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Risk score:</strong> Has it changed? A trader whose risk score has crept from 3 to 6 over several months is fundamentally changing their approach — and not in a direction I&#x27;m comfortable with.</li>
          <li><strong>Monthly returns:</strong> Are they still in line with the trader&#x27;s historical pattern? One bad month is normal. Three bad months in a row warrants closer attention.</li>
          <li><strong>Feed activity:</strong> Is the trader still posting? Are they explaining their decisions? If they&#x27;ve gone quiet, that&#x27;s worth noting.</li>
          <li><strong>Portfolio composition:</strong> Has their portfolio changed significantly? Have they shifted from stocks to leveraged CFDs? Have they concentrated into a single asset?</li>
          <li><strong>Drawdown:</strong> Where does the current drawdown stand relative to their historical max? If they&#x27;re approaching their historical max drawdown, it&#x27;s time to pay close attention.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When to Stop Copying</h3>

        <p>Stopping a copy is a big decision, and it should be based on evidence, not emotion. Here are the situations where I&#x27;ll stop copying a trader:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Their risk score has permanently increased above my comfort level (and stayed there for 2+ months)</li>
          <li>They&#x27;ve gone completely silent for 3+ months with no feed activity</li>
          <li>Their strategy has clearly changed in a way that no longer matches my criteria</li>
          <li>They&#x27;ve exceeded their historical max drawdown by a significant margin</li>
          <li>They&#x27;ve started using heavy leverage when they previously didn&#x27;t</li>
        </ul>

        <p>What I <em>don&#x27;t</em> do: stop copying after one bad month. Every trader has losing months. If the fundamental criteria still hold — risk score is stable, strategy is consistent, communication is ongoing — I ride it out.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">This is easier said than done, by the way. I&#x27;ve had months where a trader I&#x27;m copying drops 8-10%, and the urge to stop is real. I&#x27;ve learned that the best response is usually to step back, check the criteria, and make a decision based on data rather than feeling. Most of the time, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t panic.</p>

        <h2 id="common-mistakes">Common Mistakes When Choosing Traders to Copy</h2>

        <p>I&#x27;ve made most of these mistakes myself over the years. If you&#x27;re new to copy trading on eToro — or even if you&#x27;ve been doing it for a while — this list might save you some expensive lessons.</p>

        <h3>Chasing Returns</h3>

        <p>The number one mistake. You see a trader with 150% returns over the last year, you get excited, you click &quot;Copy.&quot; Two months later, they&#x27;re down 30% and you&#x27;re wondering what happened. What happened is that you selected a trader based on their best-case outcome without considering the risk that produced it.</p>

        <p>Always ask: &quot;What was the risk taken to achieve these returns?&quot; Check the risk score, the max drawdown, the leverage used. If the returns seem too good to be true relative to the risk metrics, they probably are.</p>

        <h3>Copying Too Many Traders with Small Amounts</h3>

        <p>Some people spread $500 across 10 traders — $50 each. The problem is that with such tiny allocations, the returns are negligible even when things go well, and you&#x27;re paying attention to 10 different traders for basically no meaningful impact on your overall financial picture.</p>

        <p>It&#x27;s better to copy 3-5 traders with meaningful allocations than 10 traders with pocket change. Quality over quantity. As your portfolio grows, you can add more traders.</p>

        <h3>Stopping Copying After One Bad Month</h3>

        <p>I&#x27;ve said it before and I&#x27;ll say it again: every trader has bad months. If you stop copying at the first sign of a downturn, you lock in the loss and miss the recovery. Worse, if you then jump to another trader who&#x27;s currently on a hot streak, you&#x27;re just chasing returns again — and the cycle repeats.</p>

        <p>Give your traders time. If you selected them based on solid criteria, one bad month shouldn&#x27;t change anything. Review at the end of the month, check the fundamentals, and make a rational decision.</p>

        <h3>Not Diversifying Across Trading Styles</h3>

        <p>I covered this in the portfolio section above, but it&#x27;s common enough to flag again. Copying 5 traders who all trade US tech stocks is not diversification. If the tech sector corrects, all five will drop together. Make sure your copied traders have different strategies, different asset focuses, and different risk profiles.</p>

        <h3>Ignoring the Risk Score</h3>

        <p>It&#x27;s right there on the profile. It&#x27;s one of the most important signals eToro gives you. And yet so many people skip past it entirely because they&#x27;re fixated on the return percentage. Don&#x27;t make this mistake. The risk score is your first filter. Use it.</p>

        <h3>Not Setting a Stop Loss on Copy</h3>

        <p>eToro allows you to set a Copy Stop Loss (CSL) — a threshold at which the system automatically stops copying a trader to limit your losses. Many people leave this at the default or don&#x27;t set one at all. Consider setting a CSL that matches your risk tolerance. If a copy drops by more than, say, 40%, do you really want to keep going? A CSL is a safety net that takes the emotion out of the decision.</p>

        <p class="toms-note">Full disclosure: I haven&#x27;t always used stop losses on my copies, and that&#x27;s cost me in the past. It&#x27;s one of those &quot;do as I say, not as I did&quot; situations. I&#x27;m more disciplined about it now.</p>

  <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">How do I find the best traders to copy on eToro?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">Use eToro&#x27;s search filters to find traders with at least 2 years of history, a risk score of 4 or below, consistent monthly returns, and a maximum drawdown under 20%. Look for traders who communicate with their copiers and have their own money invested. Avoid selecting traders based solely on short-term high returns — consistency and risk management matter far more than headline numbers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">What risk score should I look for when copying traders on eToro?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">A risk score between 3 and 5 is generally the sweet spot for most copy traders. A score of 1-2 means the trader is extremely conservative and returns will be very modest. A score of 6 or above means the trader is taking significant risks that could lead to large drawdowns. Anything above 7 is a red flag for most long-term copiers. I explain <a href="../etoro-risk-score-explained/">how the risk score works</a> in detail in a separate guide.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">How many traders should I copy on eToro?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">Copying between 5 and 10 traders is a reasonable range for most people. This gives you enough diversification across different trading styles and asset classes without spreading your capital too thin. The minimum copy amount on eToro is $200 per trader, so you need at least $1,000-$2,000 to build a properly diversified copy trading portfolio. I go deeper on this in my guide on <a href="../how-many-traders-to-copy-etoro/">how many traders to copy</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Should I stop copying a trader after one bad month?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">No. Every trader has losing months — even the best ones. What matters is the long-term pattern, not individual months. If a trader you&#x27;re copying has one bad month but their risk score hasn&#x27;t changed, their strategy is consistent, and they&#x27;re still communicating with copiers, there&#x27;s usually no reason to stop copying. Panic-stopping after one down month is one of the most common mistakes in copy trading.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-q">Are the top-ranked traders on eToro actually the best to copy?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">Not necessarily. eToro&#x27;s default rankings often highlight traders with the highest recent returns, which can be misleading. A trader who made 200% in one year may have done so by taking enormous risks that could just as easily result in catastrophic losses. It&#x27;s better to use eToro&#x27;s advanced filters to find traders with consistent, moderate returns over 2+ years and low risk scores, rather than relying on the default leaderboard.</p>
