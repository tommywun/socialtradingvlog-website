        <h2 id="is-copy-trading-free">Is Copy Trading on eToro Really Free?</h2>

        <p>Let me get straight to the point. eToro&#x27;s marketing says copy trading is free, and in a narrow sense, that&#x27;s true. Here&#x27;s what you genuinely do <em>not</em> pay:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No management fee to copy a trader</li>
          <li>No subscription or monthly charge</li>
          <li>No performance fee (eToro doesn&#x27;t take a cut of your profits)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Popular Investors you copy are compensated by eToro directly &#x2014; they earn a share of the spreads generated by their copiers. That cost is baked into the platform, not charged to you as a separate line item.</p>
        <p>But here&#x27;s the catch: every trade the copied trader makes on your behalf still incurs normal trading costs. You pay the same spreads, overnight fees, and conversion fees as if you&#x27;d placed those trades yourself. And because you&#x27;re copying someone else&#x27;s decisions, you&#x27;re along for the ride on every cost.</p>
        <p>I&#x27;ve seen people start copy trading thinking it&#x27;s completely free, then get confused when their balance doesn&#x27;t match the copied trader&#x27;s percentage returns. The gap is usually down to these underlying costs.</p>

        <h2 id="fees-you-still-pay">The Fees You Still Pay When Copy Trading</h2>

        <p>Here&#x27;s the full list of costs that still apply when you&#x27;re copy trading on eToro:</p>

        <p><strong>Spreads on every trade.</strong> The spread is the difference between the buy and sell price. Every time the copied trader opens or closes a position, you pay this spread on your proportional share. For stocks, it&#x27;s typically small. For CFDs, forex, and crypto, spreads are wider. If the trader makes 50 trades in a month, you&#x27;re paying 50 spreads. This is the single biggest &#x22;hidden&#x22; cost of copy trading.</p>

        <p><strong>Overnight fees on CFD positions.</strong> If the trader holds leveraged or CFD positions overnight, you pay overnight fees on your share. Charged every night at 21:00 GMT, with triple charges on Wednesdays or Fridays to cover weekends. More on this below.</p>

        <p><strong>Currency conversion fees.</strong> If you deposit in GBP, EUR, or another non-USD currency, you pay a conversion fee. The rate depends on your location, payment method, and <a href="../etoro-fees/">eToro Club tier</a>. Diamond members are exempt; everyone else pays something.</p>

        <p><strong>Withdrawal fees.</strong> $5 per withdrawal from a USD account. Local currency accounts (GBP, EUR, AUD, DKK) have free withdrawals. Not specific to copy trading, but part of your total cost.</p>

        <p><strong>The good news: no stock commissions on copy trading.</strong> Since early 2025, eToro charges a $1&#x2013;$2 commission on manually traded stocks. But here&#x27;s something that works in copy trading&#x27;s favour: <strong>copy trading is specifically exempt from this stock commission</strong>. So if the trader you&#x27;re copying buys and sells stocks, you pay zero commission on those trades. This is actually a genuine cost advantage of copy trading over manual trading, and I think it&#x27;s an underappreciated benefit.</p>

        <h2 id="real-example">Real Example: My Copy Trading Costs Over 6 Months</h2>

        <p class="toms-note">The numbers below are based on my general experience and typical patterns I&#x27;ve seen across the traders I&#x27;ve copied over the years. Every copied trader is different, so your costs will vary depending on who you copy and how they trade.</p>

        <p>Let me walk through a realistic scenario. Say you allocate $1,000 to copy a trader. Over six months, they make around 50 trades &#x2014; a mix of stocks, ETFs, and a couple of CFD positions.</p>

        <p><strong>Spread costs on stocks and ETFs:</strong> For real stock and ETF trades, spreads are tight. On 40 stock/ETF trades with an average position size of around $25 each (your $1,000 divided across the trader&#x27;s portfolio), total spread costs might be $2&#x2013;$5 over six months.</p>

        <p><strong>Spread costs on CFD trades:</strong> If 10 of those trades are CFDs (forex, commodities, leveraged positions), spreads are wider. You might pay $0.50&#x2013;$2 in spread per trade on your proportional position &#x2014; potentially $5&#x2013;$20 total.</p>

        <p><strong>Overnight fees on CFD positions:</strong> This is where it adds up. If the copied trader holds a leveraged position for 30 days, you pay an overnight fee every night. Even small fees of $0.01&#x2013;$0.05 per night compound. Two or three CFD positions held for a month each could cost $3&#x2013;$10.</p>

        <p><strong>Currency conversion:</strong> If you deposited in GBP, a typical conversion fee is 0.5&#x2013;1.5% depending on your Club tier. On $1,000 that&#x27;s $5&#x2013;$15 at deposit.</p>

        <p><strong>Total estimated cost over 6 months:</strong> Roughly $10&#x2013;$50 on a $1,000 copy allocation, depending on how the copied trader trades. A trader who sticks to real stocks costs much less than one who actively trades CFDs and forex.</p>

        <p>In perspective: $10&#x2013;$50 on $1,000 over six months is a 1&#x2013;5% drag on returns. Not catastrophic, but not nothing &#x2014; especially if the trader only returns 5&#x2013;10% in that period.</p>

        <h2 id="copy-vs-manual">Copy Trading Fees vs. Manual Trading Fees on eToro</h2>

        <p>Since the 2025 stock commission changes, copy trading is actually <em>cheaper</em> than manual trading for stocks on eToro.</p>

        <p>Manually buying a stock costs $1 commission ($2 for certain exchanges) on both opening and closing. A round trip costs $2&#x2013;$4 per trade, plus the spread. Through copy trading? $0 in commission &#x2014; just the spread.</p>

        <p>Say a trader makes 40 stock trades over a few months. Manually, you&#x27;d pay 40 x $2 = $80 in round-trip commissions. Through copy trading: $0 in commissions. Spreads are the same either way.</p>

        <p>The flipside: if the copied trader makes trades you wouldn&#x27;t have made yourself, you&#x27;re paying spreads on trades that don&#x27;t align with your strategy. And if they trade CFDs, you absorb those wider spreads and overnight fees whether you like it or not.</p>

        <p>For stock investors who want diversification across many positions, copy trading offers a genuine fee advantage right now. For full details on eToro&#x27;s trading costs, see my <a href="../etoro-fees/">eToro fees breakdown</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="200-minimum">How the $200 Minimum Affects Your Costs</h2>

        <p>The minimum amount to copy a trader on eToro is $200. That sounds accessible, and it is &#x2014; but there&#x27;s a practical issue with position sizing at that level.</p>

        <p>When you copy a trader with $200, your positions are proportional to theirs. If the trader has 20 open positions, your $200 is split across all 20 &#x2014; roughly $10 per position. Some might be as small as $2&#x2013;$5.</p>

        <p>At those sizes, spreads become proportionally more significant. A $0.05 spread on a $10 position is 0.5%. Multiply that across 20 positions and it adds up. On a $1,000 allocation, that same $0.05 spread on a $50 position is only 0.1%.</p>

        <p>There&#x27;s also a diversification issue. With $200 total, you can copy exactly one trader. If they have a bad run, your entire copy trading allocation takes the hit.</p>

        <p>My recommendation: allocate at least <strong>$500 per copied trader</strong>. This gives better position sizing, makes spread costs proportionally smaller, and means positions are large enough to meaningfully participate in market moves. $1,000 or more is even better for granular copying.</p>

        <p>If you only have $200&#x2013;$500 to start with, copying a single trader is fine. Just know that your positions will be small and cost drag slightly higher in percentage terms. For help splitting your budget, see my guide on <a href="../copy-trading.html">how copy trading works on eToro</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="overnight-fees">Overnight/Weekend Fees When Copy Trading CFDs</h2>

        <p>This is the fee that catches the most people off guard, so I want to give it its own section.</p>

        <p>When the trader you&#x27;re copying holds a CFD position (leveraged stocks, forex, commodities, indices, short positions), you pay an overnight fee on your proportional share of that position every single night it&#x27;s held open. The fee is charged at 21:00 GMT, and on Wednesdays or Fridays (depending on the asset type) the charge is triple to cover the weekend.</p>

        <p>Here&#x27;s why this matters for copy trading specifically: <strong>you don&#x27;t control when positions are opened or closed.</strong> If the trader opens a leveraged forex position and holds it for three weeks, you&#x27;re paying 21 nights of overnight fees without any say. You can&#x27;t selectively close individual positions within a copy &#x2014; you either copy fully or stop copying entirely.</p>

        <p>Over my years of copy trading, the traders who cost me the most were CFD and forex traders. Overnight fees quietly accumulated in the background, eating into gains even on profitable positions. The cheapest traders to copy were buy-and-hold stock and ETF investors &#x2014; no leverage, no CFDs, no overnight fees.</p>

        <p>If you want to understand CFD costs in more detail, my <a href="../etoro-spread-fees/">eToro spread fees guide</a> goes deeper into the numbers.</p>

        <h2 id="copy-vs-smart">Copy Trading vs. Smart Portfolios: Fee Comparison</h2>

        <p>eToro offers two main &#x22;hands-off&#x22; investment features: Copy Trading (copying individual traders) and Smart Portfolios (theme-based, professionally curated portfolios). Here&#x27;s how they compare on fees:</p>

        <p><strong>What&#x27;s the same:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Both are exempt from the $1&#x2013;$2 stock commission</li>
          <li>Neither charges a management fee or subscription</li>
          <li>Both still incur underlying spreads and overnight fees on CFD positions</li>
          <li>Currency conversion fees apply to both if you&#x27;re depositing in non-USD</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>What&#x27;s different:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Copy Trading</strong> follows an individual trader&#x27;s live decisions. Their style, risk level, and trading frequency directly determine your costs. A high-turnover CFD trader will cost you more than a buy-and-hold stock picker.</li>
          <li><strong>Smart Portfolios</strong> are theme-based (e.g., top tech stocks, renewable energy, dividend stocks). They&#x27;re rebalanced periodically by eToro, but typically have lower turnover than an active copy trader. Lower turnover generally means fewer spread costs.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In pure fee terms, Smart Portfolios tend to be slightly cheaper because of lower turnover. But the difference isn&#x27;t dramatic &#x2014; the bigger decision is whether you want to follow an individual trader&#x27;s strategy or invest in a themed basket of assets. I use both, and from a fee perspective there&#x27;s no major penalty either way.</p>

        <h2 id="minimise-costs">How to Minimise Copy Trading Costs</h2>

        <p>After nearly a decade of copy trading on eToro, here are the practical things I&#x27;ve learned about keeping costs down:</p>

        <p><strong>1. Copy traders who trade real stocks and ETFs, not CFDs.</strong> The single most impactful thing you can do. Real stock and ETF positions don&#x27;t incur overnight fees, and spreads are tight. Before copying someone, check their portfolio &#x2014; mostly unleveraged stocks and ETFs means minimal fee drag.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Favour traders with lower turnover.</strong> Every trade incurs a spread cost. A trader making 200 trades a month costs far more than one making 20. Check the trader&#x27;s stats page for trading frequency &#x2014; buy-and-hold investors are cheaper to copy.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Allocate enough per trader.</strong> $200 works but $500+ is better. Larger allocations mean bigger positions, which makes spreads proportionally smaller.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Consider your deposit currency.</strong> If you&#x27;re outside the US, conversion fees add up. A local currency account (GBP, EUR, AUD, DKK) can reduce or eliminate conversion costs.</p>

        <p><strong>5. Use the copy trading calculator.</strong> Model potential returns after costs before committing real money. My <a href="../calculators/roi-calculator/">copy trading ROI calculator</a> can help estimate net returns.</p>

        <p><strong>6. Review your copies regularly.</strong> Check in monthly to see what trades are being made, whether CFD positions are racking up overnight fees, and whether the strategy still matches your expectations. My <a href="../best-traders-to-copy-etoro/">best traders to copy on eToro</a> guide covers how to evaluate traders.</p>

      <h3 class="faq-q">Is eToro copy trading really free?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">There&#x27;s no management fee, subscription fee, or performance fee to copy a trader on eToro. However, you still pay the underlying trading costs &#x2014; spreads on every trade, overnight fees on CFD positions, currency conversion fees if applicable, and withdrawal fees.

      <h3 class="faq-q">Does the eToro stock commission apply to copy trading?</h3>
      <p class="faq-a">No. Since early 2025, eToro charges a $1&#x2013;$2 commission on manually traded stocks, but copy trading and Smart Portfolios are specifically exempt from this commission. This actually makes copy trading cheaper than manual trading for stocks.</p>

Choose traders with lower turnover &#x2014; fewer trades means fewer spread costs. Allocate at least $500 per copied trader for better position sizing. If you deposit in a non-USD currency, consider the currency conversion fee and look into eToro Club tiers for discounts.</p>
